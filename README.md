# BOLD literature harvest

Harvest list of barcoding literature from version 3 of the BOLD website [https://v3.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_Publication_PublicationSearch](https://v3.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_Publication_PublicationSearch). This list of papers on barcoding seems to be absent from more recent versions of the site. The list is retrieved by API calls that return HTML(!), which we then parse to extract internal identifier for each reference, and then make a second API call to retrieve the reference in RIS format.
