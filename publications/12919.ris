N2 - The genus Dactylorhiza Neck. ex Nevski is well known as taxonomically difficult group due to its youth, hybridization ability and high phenotypic plasticity. The aim of our research was to define taxonomical structure of this genus in the Komi Republic using molecular and morphological approaches.
The studies have been carried out during 2015-2016. 16 coenopopulations were investigated (See Table 1). From each coenopopulation (CP), we collected 30 generative plants (totally 480 samples) and then measured 19-22 morphological features (See Table 2, Fig. 1). Also, DNA was extracted from 1-2 plant samples from each CP (totally 26 samples) using «DNeasy Plant Mini Kit» (Qiagen, Germany). Primers ITS5 5’-ggaagtaaaagtcgtaacaagg-3’ and ITS-4 5'-tcctccgcttattgatatgc-3' were used for amplification the fragment ITS1-5.8S-ITS2; primers KIM 3F 5’-cgtacagtacttttgtgtttacgag-3’ and KIM 1R 5’-acccagtccatctggaaatcttggttc-3’ – for amplification the fragment matK. Nucleotide sequences were aligned with the ClustalW algorithm and edited manually in the Mega 7.0 software package. Phylogenetic trees were built in the Mega 7.0.
Cluster analysis of all studied coenopopulations using all morphometric traits revealed two large clusters (See Fig. 2): top cluster (the group of D. maculata s. l.) and bottom cluster, divided into two groups corresponding to the D. incarnata s. l. (CP 15 and 16) and allotetraploids (CP 11–14). The most important traits were: the length of bract, the width of spur and labellum, the width of lower leaves and the number of flowers. These traits may be used as diagnostic for dividing the genus. More detail study of the separate species based on morphometric data (and using the data on phytocoenology) allowed us to reveal the following species – Dactylorhiza fuchsii, D. maculata, D. incarnata s. l. (including D. cruenta), D. baltica and D. traunsteineri.
Phylogenetic tree (See Fig. 3) was created using molecular and phylogenetic analysis based on the comparison of rDNA sequences ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (GenBank IDs: МН016576–МН016603). It is clear that the genus Dactylorhiza is divided in some groups: D. incarnata s. l. (group 1), D. baltica (group 2) and third heterogeneous group that includes all other samples. Additional analysis of D. baltica (the species with the most difficult systematic) using the gene matK (See Fig. 4) confirmed its occurrence in the region.
