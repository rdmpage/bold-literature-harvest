N2 - To determine a suitable DNA barcode for the genus Neonectria, the internal transcribed spacer rDNA, &#946;-tubulin, EF-1&#945;, and RPB2 genes were selected as candidate markers. A total of 205 sequences from 19 species of the genus were analyzed. Intra- and inter-specific divergences and the ease of nucleotide sequence acquisition were treated as criteria to evaluate the feasibility of a DNA barcode. Our results indicated that any single gene among the candidate markers failed to serve as a successful barcode, while the combination of the partial EF-1&#945;, and RPB2 genes recognized all species tested. We tentatively propose the combined partial EF-1&#945; and RPB2 genes as a DNA barcode for the genus. During this study, two cryptic species were discovered, based on the combined data of morphology and DNA barcode information. We described and named these two new species N. ditissimopsis and N. microconidia.
