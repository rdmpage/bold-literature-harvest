N2 - Our investigation centered on the tropical dry forests along the Pacific coast of Honduras, aiming to elucidate the presence and abundance of minuscule grey moths during the dry season. Through specimen dissections and the taxonomic identification of the collected material, we have described three new species: Acalyptris podenasi sp. nov., A. palpiformis sp. nov., and A. tortoris sp. nov. Additionally, we documented two species previously known from neighboring countries, A. lascuevella Puplesis & Robinson and A. basicornis Remeikis & Stonis. The females of A. lascuevella were previously unknown and are documented here for the first time. Morphological examinations were complemented by DNA barcoding, particularly highlighting variation in A. lascuevella. The paper’s primary significance lies not only in the description of new species but also in uncovering their taxonomic, morphological, and molecular importance. We found that these species are unique and indicative of the previously unstudied dry forests as a distinct ecosystem. Our findings revealed several novel atypical morphological traits within the studied Nepticulidae, including unusually large signum cells in the female genitalia, a dorso-ventrally divided uncus, and asymmetrical valvae in the male genitalia. These discoveries underscore the morphological diversity of Acalyptris Meyrick and their significance in evolutionary biology. Consequently, the paper addresses a previously unknown phenomenon of the occurrence and astonishing abundance of minuscule plant-mining micromoths in dry deciduous forests during the peak of the dry season. We hope that this paper will encourage Lepidoptera taxonomists to explore micromoths in other tropical dry forests, which, while limited in distribution, hold global importance. The paper is extensively illustrated with photographs of Acalyptris adults and their genitalia, along with maps, habitats, and molecular phylogenetic trees.
