N2 - A phylogenetic and systematic study of Orius species (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) from Korea has been conducted using both morphological and molecular characters. Thirty morphological character states were coded for 10 strains of 9 species. Five molecular markers, partial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), cytochrome b (CytB), 16S rRNA (16S), 18S rRNA (18S), and 28S rRNA (28S), from mitochondrial and nuclear genes, were tested. Phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data were conducted by minimum evolution, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetic (BP) analyses. Analysis of morphological data was performed using the parsimony programs NONA, and the combined dataset of morphological and molecular data was analyzed using BP analyses. The results of this study indicate that use of COI and CytB enabled relatively effective identification of species, whereas the sequences of 16S, 18S and 28S did not enable identification of closely related species such as Orius minutus and O. strigicollis. We discuss the usefulness of the five molecular markers for determining phylogenetic relationships and identifying the species.
