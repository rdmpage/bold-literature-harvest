N2 - Butterflies provide many ecosystem services including pollination, role in increasing biodiversity, acting as food source for other organisms such as birds, reptiles, amphibians etc. They are also sensitive to environmental change, so their numbers can indicate the health of environment. Keeping these apprehensions in mind, the present work was undertaken to perform morpho-molecular study of Junonia atlites belonging to Nymphalidae. The butterflies of the Jharkhand state of India are very poorly studied, some preliminary works from this region are just limited to preparation of checklist and hobby studies lacking any scientific explanation and validation. In this work 10 sites from Jharkhand were surveyed for morpho-molecular studies on Junonia atlites, the evolutionary relationships among the studied specimens were determined following the sequencing of CO1 gene, followed by preparation of distance matrix and phylogenetic tree. Significant variation was exhibited by specimen collected from Horhap Forest and St. Xavierâ€™s College, Ranchi when compared with the other eight specimens, which is evident by the matrix score and phylogenetic tree analysis.
