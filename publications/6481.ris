N2 - Two mitochondrial genes were examined to compare an isolated population of the Adriatic brook lamprey Lampetra zanandreai in central Italy with other populations in the species range (Po plain) and with parasitic and freshwater lampreys. A single haplotype, identical to one in a Venetian sample, was found in 10 individuals from the isolated population. The reduced variability is consistent with a history of dispersal after the Pleistocene expansion of the Po basin. The results support the hypothesis of an origin of L. zanandreai and L. fluviatilis-L. planeri from a common anadromous ancestor.
