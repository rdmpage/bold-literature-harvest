N2 - Segments of the Japanese quail mitochondrial genome encompassing many tRNA and protein genes, the small and part of the large rRNA genes, and the control region have been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the relative position of these genes confirmed that the tRNA(Glu) and ND6 genes in galliform mitochondrial DNA are located immediately adjacent to the control region of the molecule instead of between the cytochrome b and ND5 genes as in other vertebrates. Japanese quail and chicken display another distinctive characteristic, that is, they both lack an equivalent to the light-strand replication origin found between the tRNA(Cys) and tRNA(Asn) genes in all vertebrate mitochondrial genomes sequenced thus far. Comparison of the protein-encoding genes revealed that a great proportion of the substitutions are silent and involve mainly transitions. This bias toward transitions also occurs in the tRNA and rRNA genes but is not observed in the control region where transversions account for many of the substitutions. Sequence alignment indicated that the two avian control regions evolve mainly through base substitutions but are also characterized by the occurrence of a 57-bp deletion/addition event at their 5' end. The overall sequence divergence between the two gallinaceous birds suggests that avian mitochondrial genomes evolve at a similar rate to other vertebrate mitochondrial DNAs.
