N2 - The complete sequence of the olive fly (Bactrocera oleae) mitochondrial genome has been determined. Two independent haplotypes, from flies of distant geographical origin (Italy and Portugal) were completely sequenced.The molecule is 15815 bp long, and shows the gene content and organization typical of insects, namely thirteen protein coding genes (PCGs) encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, two rRNAs, twenty-two tRNAs and a long (949 bp) noncoding region. The genomes of the two fly specimens share the same arrangement, differing by a mere thirty-one point mutations. The differences are mostly transitions (26) and synonymous substitutions in PCGs (21). The two new sequences are compared with others already present in the database.
