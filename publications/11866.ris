N2 - The new species Hypocrea crystalligena (Hypocreales, Ascomycota, Fungi) is described as a holomorph and characterized based on an integrated phenotypic and phylogenetic approach, using teleomorph and anamorph morphologies, culture studies and analyses of phylogenetic markers including internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 (ITS1 and 2), two last introns of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha encoding gene (tef1), and a portion of the rpb2 gene, encoding the second largest RNA polymerase subunit. Stromata of H. crystalligena show similarities with those of species from Trichoderma sect. Trichoderma but differ in several respects, including color, presence of white crystals on the surface and small ascospores. Colonies on CMD appear distinct, form colorless to white crystals on isolation, a yellowish to brown pigment and an anamorph with hyaline conidia exhibiting verticillium-like to gliocladium-like structural elements. ITS1 and 2 sequences exhibit all genus-specific features but also contain several unique hallmarks permitting development of a species-diagnostic barcode. Based on the analyses of partial rpb2 and tef1 sequences, H. crystalligena constitutes a separate evolutionary lineage with H. megalocitrina and H. psychrophila as its nearest neighbors. All these species form one phylogenetic clade with the H. pulvinata/H. citrina node.
