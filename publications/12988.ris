N2 - The two special issues—Barcodes to Biomes—mark the one-year anniversary of the 6th International Barcode of Life Conference held in Guelph, Canada. The 6th Confer- ence brought together 601 delegates from 51 nations. The diversity of talks and poster presentations revealed that the global DNA barcoding community has expanded from its original focus on building libraries of reference se- quences to a more diversified community, presenting re- search on themes ranging from systematics to food web ecology to wildlife forensics. Based on a comparison with an earlier conference, marked trends were observed in the increasing breadth of topics and in the pronounced rise of contributions employing DNA barcoding for diverse socio- economically important applications, including pest man- agement, invasive species detection, and monitoring of environmental health (Adamowicz 2015a, 2015b).
One year ago, Genome published a special open-access issue containing the abstracts from the 6th Conference (Adamowicz 2015b); that compilation highlighted the breadth of research topics and leading-edge research direc- tions. The current open-access special issues feature 24 full articles. Part 1 includes two reviews that expand upon con-

ference presentations and themes and 10 additional re- search articles associated with conference presentations, four of which are first authored by winners of a postdoc- toral or graduate student prize at the 6th Conference (Beet et al. 2016; Mark et al. 2016; Saitoh et al. 2016; Sing et al. 2016). Part 2 includes 12 additional articles—three reviews, eight research articles, and one opinion piece—that cover topics ranging from a review of the field of fungal DNA barcoding (Xu 2016) to applications of DNA barcoding for biosecurity (Hodgetts et al. 2016) to multiple novel methods of species detection (discussed below). A large virtual spe- cial issue to be published online in 2017 will collate all conference-associated papers published across multiple is- sues of Genome. These special issues of Genome complement a special collection of 16 articles in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B (Hebert et al. 2016). Together, these issues showcase the progress that has been made in apply- ing DNA barcoding in diverse ways and outline exciting future prospects for discovery.
