N2 - Pontomyia Edwards, 1926 (Diptera: Chironomidae) is a genus of exclusively marine flightless midges. There are
four described species from the Indo-Pacific, and one undescribed species known only from females, pupal skins,
and larvae from the Atlantic/Caribbean. They are poorly known owing to their small size (~1.0 mm), extremely
short adult life (< 3 h), and unusual habitat for an insect (coastal lagoons, bays, or rock pools). We reviewed
scattered literature on their biology and systematics, presented photomicrographs of the male hypogium, and
updated the geographic distribution of each species. We carried out the first molecular study to elucidate
relationships among and within three of the species. Results from our four-gene phylogenetic reconstruction using
combined gene tree and species tree approaches showed that Pontomyia natans, Pontomyia oceana, and Pontomyia
pacifica are each well-supported clades, with P. natans as sister to P. oceana + P. pacifica. Genetic distances based
on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I are extraordinarily large within P. natans and P. pacifica, which suggests
that they may be cryptic species complexes.
