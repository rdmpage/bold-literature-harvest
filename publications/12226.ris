N2 - An effective DNA marker in authentication of the family Araliaceae was screened out of the five DNA regions (matK, rbcL, ITS2, psbA-trnH and ycf5). In the present study, 1113 sequences of 276 species from 23 genera (Araliaceae) were collected from DNA sequencing and GenBank, in which 16 specimens were from 5 provinces in China and Japan. All of the sequences were assessed in the success rates of PCR amplifications, intra- and inter-specific divergence, DNA barcoding gaps and efficiency of identification. Compared with other markers, ITS2 showed superiority in species discrimination with an accurate identification of 85.23% and 97.29% at the species and genus levels, respectively, in plant samples from the 589 sequences derived from Araliaceae. Consequently, as one of the most popular phylogenetic markers, our study indicated that ITS2 was a powerful barcode for Araliaceae identification.►ITS2 had a high authentication success rate of Araliaceae species. ►ITS2 provided a great efficiency of PCR amplification. ►ITS2 exhibited significantly high levels of inter-specific discriminatory ability. ►ITS2 was more suitable than other barcodes in Araliaceae species discrimination.
