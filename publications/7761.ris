N2 - DNA barcoding is a genetic technique which uses a short section of DNA from a standardized region of the
genome to identify and discover species. The COI gene which is used as the standard DNA barcode for animals
has generated the largest sequence database for a single gene. But the most widely used analysis methods for
barcode classification which are based on genetic distance measurement have some strong limitations. The
artificial intelligence based approach such as a neural network seems to be a promising advance to the spectrum of
available methods since it uses more information contained in the sequence. But in practice, the per-class sample
size is often small and the training
of
a shallow network becomes problematic. Here in this research, we used a
de
ep neural network method called the Deep Belief Network. We argue that by transforming the input into a
compact representation, better classification could be achieved without sacrificing generalization. The results on
an empirical dataset suggested that a properly trained deep network could noticeably improve the barcoding
classification accuracy, and more importantly help to deal with the problem of distinguishing non-monophyletic
species where there existed overlap between intra- and interspecific divergence and species identification was
more difficult
