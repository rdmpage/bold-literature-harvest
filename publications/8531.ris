N2 - Knockout collections are invaluable tools for studying model organisms such as yeast. However, there are no large-scale knockout collections of human cells. Using gene-trap mutagenesis in near-haploid human cells, we established a platform to generate and isolate individual 'gene-trapped cells' and used it to prepare a collection of human cell lines carrying single gene-trap insertions. In most cases, the insertion can be reversed. This growing library covers 3,396 genes, one-third of the expressed genome, is DNA-barcoded and allows systematic screens for a wide variety of cellular phenotypes. We examined cellular responses to TNF-α, TGF-β, IFN-γ and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), to illustrate the value of this unique collection of isogenic human cell lines.
