N2 - The genetic structure of 10 populations of the Merodon aureus group from the Balkan Peninsula was examined through allozyme electrophoresis and mitochondrial DNA sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Six diagnosable cryptic taxa were identified within the morphologically defined species M. aureus Fabricius, 1805 and M. cinereus (Fabricius, 1794), with clear separation of the populations (((M. aureus A + M. aureus B) + cinereus complex) + M. aureus C). The parsimony analysis of COI sequence data of the aureus–cinereus complex using Merodon avidus A species as an outgroup resulted in two main clades, (M. aureus A + M. aureus B) and ((M. aureus C + M. cinereus B + M. cinereus C) + M. cinereus A), which differed on average by 5.7%. The observed spatial distribution of the taxonomic diversity of the group suggested that these taxa originated from a common ancestral population in the Mediterranean. Identification of genetic uniqueness and genetic endemism emphasizes the importance of molecular markers and estimation of genetic diversity in recognition of conservation units. The primary goals of the conservation measures that we propose are the protection of phylogenetic lineages within the highly diverse M. aureus group taxa and conservation of the genetic variation through management of important areas.
