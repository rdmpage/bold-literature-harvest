N2 - Mackerels of the genus Scomber are commercially important species, but their taxonomic status is still controversial. Although previous phylogenetic data support the recognition of Atlantic Scomber colias and Pacific Scomber japonicus as separate species, it is only based on the analysis of partial mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences. In an attempt to shed light on this relevant issue, we have determined the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of S. colias, S. japonicus, and Scomber australasicus. The total length of the mitogenomes was 16,568 bp for S. colias and 16,570 bp for both S. japonicus and S. australasicus. All mitogenomes had a gene content (13 protein-coding, 2 rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs) and organization similar to that observed in Scomber scombrus and most other vertebrates. The major noncoding region (control region) ranged between 865 and 866 bp in length and showed the typical conserved blocks. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a monophyletic origin of Scomber species with regard to other scombrid fish. The major finding of this study is that S. colias and S. japonicus were significantly grouped in distinct lineages within Scomber cluster, which phylogenetically constitutes evidence that they may be considered as separate species. Additionally, molecular data here presented provide a useful tool for evolutionary as well as population genetic studies.
