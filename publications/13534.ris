N2 - An account is provided of the discovery of Simacauda dicommatias (Meyrick, 1931)
(Incurvariidae) at 26 sites in Cornwall, England, all in the larval stage, being initially leafminers
then case-bearers on South American members of the Myrtaceae, mainly Luma
apiculata (DC.) Burret, with moths being reared, and species identification confirmed by
genitalic examination. This is the first time that the species has been found in the British Isles
and it is unknown in mainland Europe. S. dicommatias is native to Argentina and Chile where
it occurs in Andean (Valdivian) temperate rainforests. The biology appears to be unknown
there, although adults have been collected around stands of L. apiculata. The generic identity
is additionally confirmed by a DNA barcode (658 base pairs) obtained from the abdomen of
one specimen from Cornwall. This matches (within 1.69% divergence for 296 comparable
nucleotides) a COI fragment on BOLD from a specimen collected in Parque Nacional
Puyehue, Chile, which is there misidentified as Simacauda virescens Nielsen & Davis, 1981, but
is 8.75% divergent from another two short sequences (correctly) so identified. It is known that
William Lobb, whilst employed by James Veitch & Son, imported L. apiculata (now an invasive
species in the British Isles), with one or more other Chilean Myrtaceae in the mid-1840s. It
remains to be tested if S. dicommatias may prove to be the earliest known example of an
established adventive insect accidentally introduced from South America to the British Isles.
