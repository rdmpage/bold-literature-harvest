N2 - Reverse complementary DNA sequences––
sequences that are inadvertently cast backward and in
which all purines and pyrimidines are transposed––are not
uncommon in sequence databases, where they may introduce noise into sequence-based research. We show that
about 1% of the public fungal ITS sequences, the most
commonly sequenced genetic marker in mycology, are
reverse complementary, and we introduce an open source
software solution to automate their detection and reorientation. The MacOSX/Linux/UNIX software operates on
public or private datasets of any size, although some 50
base pairs of the 5.8S gene of the ITS region are needed for
the analysis.
