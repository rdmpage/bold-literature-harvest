N2 - Worldwide knowledge of tardigrade fauna is still limited, and many areas such as South America are not well studied. The collection of new substrates in Argentinean urban areas provided an opportunity to describe the new tardigrade species Macrobiotus kristenseni sp. nov. This species has been studied with an integrative taxonomic approach, analysing its morphology by light and scanning electron microscopy, and considering two genes (cox1 and 18S rRNA) for DNA barcoding and phylogenetic purposes. The species belongs to the Macrobiotus hufelandi group of species, and it is characterized by egg processes in the shape of elongated cones with truncated and enlarged apexes, and by a high genetic distance with respect to closely related species (cox1: 18.2–33.4%). Morphological and molecular data show that the Macrobiotus hufelandi group of species has to be considered a true biological entity; one of the more widespread tardigrade lineages in continental environments. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:2CA51ABA-5570-4AFB-8182-CE499D97B0F1
