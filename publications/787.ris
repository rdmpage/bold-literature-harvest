N2 - The nucleotide sequence of the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus, order Lagomorpha) was determined. The length of the molecule is 17,245 nt, but the length is not absolute due to the presence of different numbers of repeated motifs in the control region. The organization and gene contents of the mtDNA of the rabbit conform to those of other eutherian species. The putative secondary structures of the tRNAs of the rabbit have been described. These structures as well as the structure of the L-strand origin of replication comply with those characteristic for eutherians in general. The compositional differences between the two mtDNA strands have also been detailed.
