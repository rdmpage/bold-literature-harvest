N2 - Plasmodium (Novyella) unalis sp. nov. was found in the Great Thrush, Turdus fuscater (Passeriformes, Turdidae) in Bogotá, Colombia, at 2,560 m above sea level where the active transmission occurs. This parasite is described based on the morphology of its blood stages and a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (lineage UN227). Illustrations of blood stages of new species are given, and the phylogenetic analysis identifies closely related species and lineages of avian malaria parasites. The new species is most similar to Plasmodium (Novyella) vaughani (lineage SYAT05), a cosmopolitan avian malaria parasite; these parasites are also closely related genetically, with a genetic difference of 3.2% between them. P. unalis can be readily distinguished from the latter species morphologically, primarily due to the (1) presence of a single large, circular shaped pigment granule in the erythrocytic trophozoites and meronts; (2) presence of prominent vacuoles in trophozoites and growing meronts; and (3) presence of predominantly fan-like shaped erythrocytic meronts. Cytochrome b lineages with high similarity to the new species have been reported in Costa Rica, Brazil, Chile, and USA. It is probable that the new species of malaria parasite is widely distributed in the New World. This parasite has been reported only in the Great Thrush at the study site and might have a narrow range of avian hosts. Records of P. unalis are of particular theoretical interest due to its active transmission at highlands in Andes. Possible influence of urbanization on transmission of this malaria parasite in Bogotá is discussed.
