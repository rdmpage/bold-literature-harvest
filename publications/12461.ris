N2 - Shuh-Sen Young, Mei-Hui Ni, and Ming-Yun Liu (2012) Systematic study of the Simocephalus sensu stricto species group (Cladocera: Daphniidae) from Taiwan by morphometric and molecular analyses. Zoological Studies 51(2): 222 231. There is some controversy regarding the traditional taxonomy of the Simocephalus sensu stricto species group. We conducted molecular and morphometric analyses to differentiate the 3 species from this group found in Taiwan: S. vetulus (O.F. MÃ¼ller, 1776), S. vetuloides Sars, 1898, and S. mixtus Sars, 1903. The landmark method was employed, followed by a transfer into 24 characteristic values for a principal component analysis (PCA), the results of which indicated morphometric overlap among these species. The dorsal angle, brood size, and body length were = smallest in S. vetulus, medium in S. vetuloides, and largest in S. mixtus. In the Simocephalus sensu stricto group from Taiwan, the dorsal angle and body length were significantly correlated with brood size in a quadratic manner. In the molecular analysis, 98 specimens of Simocephalus were used, and the 641-bp mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 sequence was employed as a marker to analyze the genetics of S. vetulus, S. vetuloides, S. mixtus, S. serrulatus (Koch, 1841), and S. heilongjiangensis Shi and Shi, 1994. Simocephalus vetulus, S. vetuloides, and S. mixtus shared several haplotypes, and the interspecific genetic distance was merely 0.00671-0.00785, which is within the range of intraspecific differences. We concluded that S. vetulus, S. vetuloides, and S. mixtus in Taiwan belong to the same species and should be treated as S.cf. vetulus. The number of species of Simocephalus in Taiwan is thus reduced to 3: S. cf. vetulus, S. serrulatus, and S. heilongjiangensis
