N2 - Bees are major pollinators of Angiosperms and therefore their apparent decline is of importance
for humans and biodiversity. We synthesise results of 12 recent reviews to provide a global picture of
the threats they face. Habitat loss is the major threat to bee diversity, whilst invasive species, emerging
diseases, pesticide use, and climate change also have the potential to impact bee populations. We suggest
that future conservation strategies need to prioritise (i) minimising habitat loss, (ii) making agricultural
habitats bee-friendly, (iii) training scientists and the public in bee taxonomy and identification, (iv) basic
autecological and population genetic studies to underpin conservation strategies, (v) assessing the value of
DNA barcoding for bee conservation, (vi) determining the impact of invasive plants, animals, parasites and
pathogens, and (vii) integrating this information to understand the potential impact of climate change on
current bee diversity.
