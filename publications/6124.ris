N2 - The soil and moss dwelling oribatid mite family Scutoverticidae is considered to represent an assemblage of distantly related but morphologically similar genera. We used nucleotide sequences of one mitochondrial (COI) and two nuclear (28S rDNA, ef-1alpha) genes, and 79 morphological characters to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among 11 nominal plus two undescribed European mite species of the family Scutoverticidae with a particular focus on the genus Scutovertex. Both molecular genetic and morphological data revealed a paraphyletic genus Scutovertex, with S. pictus probably representing a distinct genus, and Provertex kuehnelti was confirmed as member of the family Scutoverticidae. Molecular genetic data confirmed several recently described Scutovertex species and thus the high species diversity within this genus in Europe and suggest that S. sculptus represents a complex of several cryptic species exhibiting marked genetic, but hardly any morphological divergence.
