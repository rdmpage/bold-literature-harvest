N2 - Phylogenetic relationship of Limonium and other genera of Plumbaginaceae in China were studied using the cp rbcL, matK and the intergene spacer of trnL-trnF. The analysis showed that Plumbaginaceae was strongly supported monophyletic group sister to Polygonacea, and two tribes were comfirmed by phylogenetic analysis in Plumbaginaceae. Preliminary genetic diversity of Limonium sinense in China was also analyzed in this study by nrDNA (ITS) and cp DNA (two regions of intergenic spacers, trnL-trnF and psbA-trnH). The results showed that the population genetic diversity was low perhaps for human activities and breeding system of this species. These results have been used to understand the evolutionary and demographic history of L. sinense, which is a requisite to establish efficient conservation measures for this species.
