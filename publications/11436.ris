N2 - As part of a large, ongoing study of invasive infections in pediatric patients in Bamako, Mali, 106 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were identified from June 2002 to July 2003 (J. D. Campbell et al., Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 23:642-649, 2004). Of the 12 serotypes present, the majority of isolates were not contained in PCV7 (the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), including 1 isolate that was serotype 1, 12 isolates that were serotype 2, 58 isolates that were serotype 5, 7 isolates that were serotype 7F, and 1 isolate that was serotype 12F. To determine whether clonal dissemination of the predominant serotypes had taken place, genotyping was performed on 100 S. pneumoniae isolates by using two methods: pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI-digested genomic DNA, and the Bacterial Barcodes repetitive-element PCR (rep-PCR) method. Criteria for delineating rep-PCR genotypes were established such that isolates of different serotypes were generally not grouped together. The two methods were equally discriminatory within a given pneumococcal serotype. PFGE separated the isolates into 15 genotypes and 7 subtypes; rep-PCR separated isolates into 15 genotypes and 6 subtypes. Using either method, isolates within serotypes 2, 5, and 7 formed three large, separate clusters containing 1 genotype each. Both methods further distinguished related subtypes within serotypes 2 and 5. Interestingly, one of the PFGE subtypes of serotype 5 is indistinguishable from the Columbia5-19 clone circulating in Latin America since 1994. The data support that serotypes 2 and 5 were likely to be the result of dissemination of particular clones, some of which are responsible for invasive disease over a broad population range.
