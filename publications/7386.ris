N2 - The completion of the land bridge between North and South America approximately 3.5–3.1 million years
ago (Ma) initiated a tremendous biogeographic event called the Great American Biotic Interchange
(GABI), described principally from the mammalian fossil record. The history of biotic interchange
between continents for taxonomic groups with poor fossil records, however, is not well understood.
Molecular and fossil data suggest that a number of plant and animal lineages crossed the Isthmus of Panama
well before 3.5 Ma, leading biologists to speculate about trans-oceanic dispersal mechanisms. Here
we present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the frog genus Pristimantis based on 189 individuals of
137 species, including 71 individuals of 31 species from Panama and Colombia. DNA sequence data were
obtained from three mitochondrial (COI, 12S, 16S) and two nuclear (RAG-1 and Tyr) genes, for a total of
4074 base pairs. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis showed statistically significant conflict with most
recognized taxonomic groups within Pristimantis, supporting only the rubicundus Species Series, and the
Pristimantis myersi and Pristimantis pardalis Species Groups as monophyletic. Inference of ancestral areas
based on a likelihood model of geographic range evolution via dispersal, local extinction, and cladogenesis
(DEC) suggested that the colonization of Central America by South American Pristimantis involved at
least 11 independent events. Relaxed-clock analyses of divergence times suggested that at least eight of
these invasions into Central America took place prior to 4 Ma, mainly in the Miocene. These findings contribute
to a growing list of molecular-based biogeographic studies presenting apparent temporal conflicts
with the traditional GABI model.
