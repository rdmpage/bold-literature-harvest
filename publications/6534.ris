N2 - The complete nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial genome of the Great bustard (Otis tarda) was determined by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The genome is 16,849 bp in size, containing 13 protein-coding, 2 ribosomal and 22 transfer RNA genes. Sequences of the tRNA genes can be folded into canonical cloverleaf secondary structure except for tRNA-Cys and tRNA-Ser (AGY), which lose "DHU" arm. Sequence analysis showed that the O. tarda mitochondrial control region (mtCR) contained many elements in common with other avian mtCRs. A microsatellite repeat was found in the 3'-peripheral domain of the O. tarda mtCR. Based on the mitochondrial DNA sequences of 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA and tRNA-Val, a phylogenetic study of Gruiformes was performed. The result showed that Otididae was a sister group to "core Gruiformes" and Charadriiformes with strong support (97% posterior probability values) in Bayesian analysis. The taxonomic status of Rhynochetidae, Mesitornithidae, Pedionomidae and Turnicidae that traditionally belonged to Gruiformes was also discussed in this paper.
