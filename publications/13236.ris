N2 - Traditionally, entomologists have used morphological characteristics for mosquito taxonomy and systematics. However, this approach does not take into consideration the genetic relatedness of species. In 2000, the Aedes genus of mosquitoes in the tribe Aedini was split into two genera (Aedes and Ochlerotatus), thereby elevating Ochlerotatus from subgenus to genus rank, strictly based on morphology of adults. Herein, we use the genetic barcoding marker COI to generate a phylogeny of 65 species of Aedes, Ochlerotatus, and Anopheles outgroup from almost 900 sequences downloaded from BOLD systems. Our results reveal evidence of non-random, but polyphyletic clustering of Aedes and Ochlerotatus species, with a monophyletic outgroup. We do find support for the validity of Ochlerotatus as an evolutionary unit, although we find insufficient evidence to support its retention as a genus. We suggest that mosquito phylogenetic analyses incorporate a greater number of genetic markers to help clarify our understanding of Aedini species classifications, but caution that recent assessments based solely on morphology may be insufficient.
