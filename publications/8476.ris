N2 - Seven fungal isolates were identified as pan-global Hypocrea/Trichoderma species, from section  Trichoderma, on the basis of their morphology. These species were H. lixii/T. harzianum and  H. orientalis/T. longibrachiatum. PCR-based markers with primer M13 (core sequence of phage M13) and internal-transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA were used to confirm the identity of the two Trichoderma species. Sequence identification was performed using the TrichOKEY version 2.0 barcode program and the multilocus similarity search database TrichoBLAST. Sequences from the ribosomal DNA internal-transcribed spacer regions showed limited variation among the Trichoderma species. This analysis divided the isolates into two main groups. Grouping the isolates based on cluster analysis of their DNA profiles matched the grouping based on morphological taxonomy. Molecular data obtained from analyses of gene sequences are essential to distinguish phonetically cryptic species in this group and to establish phylogenetic relationships
