N2 - Caenis americani sp. nov. is described based on larvae and female imagoes from the Mangalamkombu stream of Southern
India. Caenis americani is most likely a parthenogenetic species, in the light of the fact that only females have been
collected. The larva can be distinguished from other species of Caenis by the i) shape of the sternum IX and its shagreen
field, ii) shape and denticulation of hind claws and iii) lateral lobes of mesonotum distinctly bulged. The phylogenetic
relationships of the new species remain unknown, as molecular records of Caenis throughout the Oriental region are
largely unknown, and the taxonomically important males are absent.
