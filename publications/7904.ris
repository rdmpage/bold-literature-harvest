N2 - Ancient lakes represent one of the most stable freshwater environments on Earth, with a species richness clearly exceeding that of younger and more short-lived limnic habitats. In most cases, the biological colonization of old lake systems must have occurred via the surrounding rivers. Two ancient lake systems of Sulawesi (Malili lake system and Lake Poso) have been studied in terms of the taxonomy and phylogeny of freshwater crabs (Decapoda: Brachyura: Gecarcinucidae: Parathelphusinae). Both systems have been colonized twice independently, and in both systems we can find three trophic niches which are always occupied by different crab species: molluskivores, omnivores, and detritivores. In the present study, we reconstruct phylogenies of freshwater crabs from more than 20 river systems of Sulawesi. We thereby confirm two independent colonization events for both ancient lake systems, with subsequent radiations. The phylogenies imply that the lineages which evolved into the molluskivore forms were the first ones to colonize, whereas omnivores and detritivores are derived from later colonization events and, based on their monophyletic relationship, resulted from minor lacustrine radiations. Most of the diversity of freshwater crabs from Sulawesi remains taxonomically undescribed. This study uncovers several undocumented phylogenetic units, with long independent evolutionary histories according to patristic distances.
