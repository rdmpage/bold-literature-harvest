N2 - An increasing number of phylogenetic analyses is no longer translated into classifications. The resulting phylogeny/classification gap is undesirable because the precise transmission of phylogenetic insights depends on the frequent revision of Linnaean names. The move away from classifying has numerous correlates. These include: an expanded pool of researchers who are able to produce phylogenetic estimates, a mismatch between the properties of molecular phylogenies and the requirements for verbal Linnaean definitions, the emphasis of statistical representations over the creation and evaluation of scientific terms, and a partial disconnect between the processes of nomenclature and taxonomy. The “taxonomic concept” approach allows systematists to express their varying perspectives with a high precision and can therefore help reduce the aforementioned gap. The phylogeny/classification link must persist in order to ensure community-wide access to, and continued testing of, the products of systematic research.© The Willi Hennig Society 2005.
