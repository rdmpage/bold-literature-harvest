N2 - In the present study, we made further investigation into the diversity of Trichoderma in China than previous ones utilizing comprehensive approaches of morphological microscopic observation and phylogenetic analysis by detecting molecular markers. One thousand nine hundred ten Trichoderma strains were isolated from soil or other materials in China: East (Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, Zhejiang province and Shanghai municipality), South-West (Guizhou, Qinghai, Shanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan province, Tibet Autonomous Region and Chongqing municipality), South-East (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan province), and Middle China (Henan, Hubei and Hunan province). Representative isolates were verified at the species level by morphological characters and the oligonucleotide barcode program TrichoOKey v.10 and the custom BLAST server TrichoBLAST, using sequence of the ITS 1 and 2 region of the rDNA cluster and partial sequences of translation elongation factor 1-alpha(tef1-Î±). A total of 23 Trichoderma species were identified : T.asperellum, T.atrioviride, T.aureovriride, T.brevicompactum, T.citrioviride, T.erinaceum, T.gamsii, T.hamatum, T.harzianum (H.1ixii), T.intricatum, T.koningii (H.koningii), T.koningiopsis, T.longibranchiatum, T.pleuroticola, T.reeseii (H.jecorina), T.sinensis, T.spirale, T.stromaticum, T.tomentosum, T.velutinum, T.vermipilum, T.virens (H.virens), T.viride. Among them, 3 species: T.intricatum, T.stromaticum, T.vermipilum were first reported in China; T.harzianum (H,1ixii) was the most widely distributed species in China. This study further shows that, the highest biodiversity of Trichoderma population appeared in South-West China.
