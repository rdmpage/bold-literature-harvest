N2 - Delimitations of species are crucial for correct and precise identification of taxa. Unfortunately “species”
is more a subjective than an objective concept in taxonomic practice due to difficulties in revealing
patterns of infra- or inter-specific variations. Molecular phylogenetic studies at the population
level solve this problem and lay a sound foundation for DNA barcoding. In this paper we exemplify the
necessity of adopting a phylogenetic concept of species in DNA barcoding for tree peonies (Paeonia
sect. Moutan). We used 40 samples representing all known populations of rare and endangered species
and several populations of widely distributed tree peonies. All currently recognized species and major
variants have been included in this study. Four chloroplast gene fragments, i.e. ndhF, rps16-trnQ, trnL-F
and trnS-G (a total of 5040 characters, 96 variable and 69 parsimony-informative characters) and one
variable and single-copy nuclear GPAT gene fragment (2093&#8722;2197 bp, 279 variable and 148 parsimony-
informative characters) were used to construct phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. The
evolutionary lineages revealed by the nuclear gene and the chloroplast genes are inconsistent with the
current circumscriptions of P. decomposita, P. jishanensis, P. qiui, and P. rockii based on morphology.
The inconsistencies come from (1) significant chloroplast gene divergence but little nuclear GPAT gene
divergence among population systems of P. decomposita + P. rockii, and (2) well-diverged nuclear GPAT
gene but little chloroplast gene divergence between P. jishanensis and P. qiui. The incongruence of the
phylogenies based on the chloroplast genes and the nuclear GPAT gene is probably due to the chloroplast
capture event in evolutionary history, as no reproductive barriers exist to prevent inter-specific
hybridization. We also evaluated the suitability of these genes for use as DNA barcodes for tree peonies.
The variability of chloroplast genes among well-defined species or population systems of a species
complex is 4.82 times the figure within the groups, and the GPAT gene is twice as variable between the
groups as within the groups.
