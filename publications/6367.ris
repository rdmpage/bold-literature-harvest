N2 - The taxonomic status of Allolobophora chlorotica is still the subject of considerable discussion. After the recent experimental demonstration that the two regularly observed colour morphs (pink and green) were not fully interfertile and likely represent two distinct species, molecular analyses revealed a more complex picture with the occurrence of five mitochondrial lineages (named L1 to L5) in A. chlorotica, two within the green morph and three within the pink morph. Although nuclear markers (AFLPs) confirmed that the pink morph might consist of three different taxa, AFLPs data suggested that the green morph may be a single taxon. In order to further characterize the population genetic structure within A. chlorotica in addition to test for reproductive isolation between lineages, eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed using a microsatellite-enriched genomic library from an individual belonging to lineage L2. The number of alleles per locus varied from 9 to 29 in a set of individuals belonging to L2. Considerable sub-structure was observed within L2 populations suggesting a low dispersal capability in this species and a distribution of the individuals in patches that could function as panmictic units. These markers were transferable to the other lineages but only five loci could be amplified consistently in four of the lineages (L1, L2, L3 and L4). Microsatellite data confirmed that the green morph represents a single taxon. Although the integrity of the three previously documented lineages within the pink morph was also generally supported by the data, microsatellites provided evidence for hybridization between lineages and between morphs in the field. Moreover, mitochondrial data revealed the existence of two additional mitochondrial lineages within the pink morph. The taxonomic status of the pink morph remains thus unclear, requiring a thorough and comprehensive study.
