N2 - The male, female, pupa and larva of Simulium litobranchium n. sp. are described and illustrated. This new species has 12 gill filaments, as do S. duodenicornium Pepinelli, Hamada & Trivinho-Strixino, S. guianense Wise, S. hirtipupa Lutz, S. perplexum Shelley, Maia-Herzog, Lunas Dias & Couch and S. scutistriatum Lutz, but it can be distinguished from these other species by a combination of characters observed at the pupal and adult stages. DNA barcoding showed that Simulium litobranchium n. sp. exhibits more than 4% nucleotide divergence in cytochrome oxidase I from three other closely related species in the Neotropical subgenus S. (Thyrsopelma). The new species was collected in the Brazilian states of Goias and Minas Gerais and inhabits rivers 30-40 m in width in the Parana River hydrographic basin. Females were not observed engaging in anthropophilic behavior.
