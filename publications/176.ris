N2 - The phylogenetic relationships among 21 species of stromateoid fishes, representing five families and 13 genera, were reconstructed using 3263bp of mitochondrial DNA sequences, including the posterior half of the 16S rRNA and entire COI and Cytb genes. The resultant molecular phylogenies were compared with previous phylogenetic hypotheses inferred from morphological characters. Molecular phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. All three methods resulted in well-resolved trees with most nodes being supported by moderate to high support values. In contrast to previous morphological analyses, which resulted in non-monophyly of Centrolophidae, all three methods utilized for the present molecular analyses supported the monophyly of Centrolophidae, as well as the reciprocal monophyly of the other stromateoid families, previous morphological hypotheses being rejected by the Templeton and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests. In addition, the three methods indicated a sister-group relationship between Ariommatidae and Nomeidae. The position of Tetragonuridae was, however, incongruent between the MP method and the ML and Bayesian methods, being placed in the most basal position of Stromateoidei in the former, but occupying a sister relationship to Stromateidae in the latter. Comparison of the molecular phylogenies to previous morphological hypotheses suggested that evolutionary changes in morphological characters have not occurred equally among the stromateoid lineages, the evolution of the centrolophids not having been accompanied by appreciable morphological changes, whereas other stromateoids have undergone considerable morphological changes during their evolutionary history. The molecular phylogenies also shed some light on the evolutionary pattern of the pharyngeal sac, two of the four types of sac corresponding to two main lineages of Stromateoidei. Some taxonomic implications were also discussed.
