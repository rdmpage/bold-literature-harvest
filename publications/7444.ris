N2 - The biogeography of species is discussed in-depth in relation to current knowledge
of the geological events that have shaped New Zealand and influenced the
distribution of species.
Preliminary molecular analysis (Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) mitochondrial
DNA barcoding, 800 base pairs) is almost in full concordance with the
groupings formed through morphological cladistic analysis, but the molecular
analysis could not distinguish species in the tillyardianum-subgroup. Austrosimulium
ungulatum, recognised from morphological evidence to be a single entity,
is shown to comprise 4 haplotypes. Similarly, some other species show multiple
haplotypes. Further, A. vexans of the Auckland Islands is sister to an aggregate of
haplotypes previously assumed to be A. ungulatum. Austrosimulium dumbletoni
and A. vailavoense, taxonomically placed in the ungulatum-subgroup because of
morphological characters, are shown by molecular analysis to be in the unicornesubgroup;
and that subgroup is sister to all remaining New Zealand Austrosimulium.
Further, A. australense probably comprises 2 species, one primarily North Island,
the other precinctive to the South Island and Stewart Island and that cannot be
distinguished on current morphological characters.
The molecular analysis indicated that New Zealand Austrosimulium originally
arrived by dispersal well after the so-called Oligocene Great Inundation ca 34â€“23
Mya, and the concatenation of the large tillyardianumsubgroup even more strongly
indicated that it is a segregate of recent origin. That the unicorne-subgroup of species
require cold water, high altitude habitats in the Southern Alps, that at maximum
are only some 5 million years of age, indicates that New Zealand Austrosimulium
is unlikely to be older.
