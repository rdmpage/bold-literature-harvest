N2 - The mitochondrial genome of the scorpion Centruroides limpidus (Chelicerata; Arachnida) has been completely sequenced and is 14519 bp long. The genome contains 13 protein-encoding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 21 transfer RNA genes and a large non-coding region related to the control region. The overall A+T composition is the lowest among the complete mitochondrial sequences published within the Chelicerata subphylum. Gene order and gene content differ slightly from that of Limulus polyphemus (Chelicerata: Xiphosura): i.e., the lack of the trnD gene, and the translocation-inversion of the trnI gene. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of some Chelicerata shows that scorpions (C. limpidus and Mesobuthus gibbosus) make a tight cluster with the spiders (Arachnida; Araneae). Our analysis does not support that Scorpiones order is the sister group to all Arachnida Class, since it is closer to Araneae than to Acari orders.
