N2 - The Southern Ocean is characterized by the complex system of oceanic fronts that maintain the latitudinal zonality of biotopes. These fronts are boundaries of water masses with different hydrophysical characteristics. We explore the genetic differentiation of the dominant zooplankton species in regards to the complex hydrophysical zonality of the Southern Ocean. The barcoding region of mitochondrial CO1 gene was sequenced for three copepod species, Calanus simillimus, Rhincalanus gigas, and Metridia lucens. These species are the most abundant in the Southern Ocean and form the basis of the zooplankton community. Genetic differentiation was found neither for Calanus simillimus nor for Rhincalanus gigas. The mitochondrial haplotypes of Metridia lucens cluster in two genetically distant groups (Subantarctic and Antarctic) found together only in the Polar Front Zone.
