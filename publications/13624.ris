N2 - Alpiscorpius liburnicus sp. n. is described from Krk Island, Croatia, as the first cave dwelling scorpion species in the genus. Clear differences from the genetically closest epigean species were found in metasomal morphometry. Its delineation is supported phylogenetically based on mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA) and nuclear (ITS1) markers. In the barcode fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene (COI), the uncorrected pairwise genetic distances to other known taxa in “Alpiscorpius croaticus group” range between 4.2 and 4.8 %. The first molecular evidence of the species’ presence on the coastal part of Mt. Velebit implies its potential distribution in the whole of the eastern Adriatic coastal area, roughly from Rijeka City area to the source of the Zrmanja River. The new species is sympatric with common epigean taxa of the “Euscorpius tergestinus group” and with the synanthropic E. italicus in Mediterranean habitats. The phylogenetic relationships within the “A. croaticus group” are estimated. Localities of epigean A. croaticus are restricted to the continental side of southern and southeastern parts of Mt. Velebit. There it is sympatric and syntopic with the smaller A. omega in karst beech forests, with an extrazonal enclave in the Velika Paklenica canyon area on the southern slopes of the mountain. The third taxon in the group is known at the moment from a single locality in the middle part of Mt. Velebit, where it is also syntopic with A. omega in a beech forest near limestone cliffs.
