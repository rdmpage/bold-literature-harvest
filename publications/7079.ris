N2 - Mistakenly classifying morphologically cryptic endemic species as populations of widespread species
potentially interferes with the conservation of biodiversity because undetected endemics that are imperilled
may lack appropriate protection. It also impedes the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of a
taxon by obscuring the number and distributional limits of species. Here, we present genetic and phylogenetic
evidence corroborated by morphology that Philippine populations of seven widespread, nonmigratory
passerine birds might represent unrecognized, distinct species. An extrapolation based on this
finding suggests that the proportion of endemic bird species in the Philippines could be much higher than
currently estimated. This high degree of cryptic diversity in a well-studied, volant taxon implies that
large numbers of unrecognized species can be expected in less thoroughly studied groups. We predict
that genetic investigations of insular populations of widespread species will frequently reveal unrecognized
island endemics, and because of the vulnerability of island habitats and their biota, these taxa
may be particularly susceptible to extinction.
