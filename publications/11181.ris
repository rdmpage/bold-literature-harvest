N2 - Cryptic mutations producing no observable effect on phenotype can both spark divergence into species and assist species identification. Unlike most protein-encoding sequences, a barcode sequence of great utility in phylogenetic analysis displays few interspecies differences at amino acid-determining codon positions (static conventional phenotype), but many at third codon positions (mobile genome phenotype).
