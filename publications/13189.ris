N2 - Species of new world silversides (Actinopterygii; Atherinopsidae; genus Odontesthes) possess economic relevance, biological
interest and ecological importance. In the present paper we: (A) investigate the molecular diversity in marine species
of Odontesthes from the South West Atlantic Ocean (SWAO), and analyse their interspecific relationships and divergence
by means of DNA Barcoding, including its freshwater congeners, as well. (B) Explore the suitability of DNA Barcoding to
analyse the diversity and distribution of haplotypes in Odontesthes argentinensis, the only well documented marine species
from the SWAO that exhibit putative estuarine and marine populations. Molecular analysis revealed 100% of agreement
between morphological identification and molecular identity. Odontesthes argentinensis, Odontesthes platensis, Odontesthes
smitti, Odontesthes nigricans and Odontesthes incisa were assigned to five different barcode index numbers (BINs).
Maximum-likelihood analysis showed that all marine species of Odontesthes clustered separately in a unique monophyletic
phylogroup, comprising five well defined haplogroups, with genetic divergence between groups ranging from 2.75 to 7.11%.
The genetic analysis including freshwater congeners showed that O. incisa clustered alone occupying a basal position. The
Fst
pairwise comparisons within O. argentinensis support the existence of three population groups: one conformed by Mar
Chiquita Lagoon (MCh) specimens, and the others by Mar del Plata/Mar Chiquita coast and San Blas Bay coastal specimens,
respectively. The AMOVA showed significant overall differentiation (
Fst = 0.238; p = 0.00001) for the entire data set.
The previous/present evidence is discussed, and strongly suggests that incipient speciation is occurring in O. argentinensis
argentinean populations, and specimens from MCh would be considered at present as the leading candidate of a marine to
freshwater incipient speciation event.
