N2 - An extraction, purification, PCR amplification and sequencing of DNA from five species of Phyllanthus in
Nigeria namely P. amarus Schum and Thonn, P. urinaria Linn., P. odontadenius Mull-Arg., P. niruroides Mull-Arg. and P.
muellerianus (O. Ktze) Excel belonging to the family of Phyllanthaceae were carried out using nuclear ribosomal Internal
Transcribed Spacer (ITS 4-5) genetic marker to identify unknown Phyllanthus species. The nuclear region revealed that the
Phyllanthus species were able to be amplified optimally for sequencing. The results of the nucleotide sequences were further
compared on Basic Local Alignment Sequence Tool (BLAST) on GenBank and BoldSystems for validation. Results revealed
that the closely related species, P. niruroides Mull_Arg. and P. odontadenius Mull-Arg. had no DNA record to separate them
on both GenBank and BoldSystems while P. amarus Schum and Thonn, P. muellerianus (O. Ktze) Excel and P. urinaria Linn.
were clearly compatible with other works. The sequence data were analyzed and classified with tree-based analyses of
Mr.Bayes 3.2.1. in order to reveal their phylogenetic relationship. Results of the nucleotide sequences and fragment analysis
were published on BoldSystems for barcoding as non-coding marker translation matrix.
