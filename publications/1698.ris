N2 - In study of gene expression profile in cloned embryos which derived from D. rerio embryonic nuclei and G. rarus enucleated eggs, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI) of G. rarus, exhibiting difference at expression level between cloned embryos and zebrafish embryo, was cloned. Its full cDNA length is 1654 bp and contains a 1551 bp open reading frame, encoding a 5.64 kDa protein of 516 amino acids. The alignment result shows that mitochondrion tRNAser is co-transcripted with COXI, which just was the 3'-UTR of COXI. Molecular phylogenic analysis based on COXI indicates G. rarus should belong to Gobioninae, which was not in agreement with previous study according to morphological taxonomy. Comparison of DNA with cDNA shows that RNA editing phenomenon does not occur in the COXI of G. rarus.
