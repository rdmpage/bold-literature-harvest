N2 - The genus Pliocaloca Neboiss consists of five species, of which the larva of only one, P. kleithria Shackleton, is known. Here we associate the larva of P. fidesria Shackleton. The larva is associated with adult males based on molecular and geographical data. Adult males and larvae were collected from the same location at Saddle Tree Creek, Bunya Mountains National Park (NP), southern Queensland. A 657 base pair (bp) fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase sub unit 1 (COI) was used to verify species association. Two larvae and two adult males successfully yielded COI sequences. Sequences of the larvae and one of the adult males were identical. The other adult male differed from these by only one nucleotide. The larva of P. fidesria can be distinguished from P. kleithria by the presence of 9 setae in setal area 1 of the metanotum, the posterior margin of the pigmentation on the mesonotum being well defined, and the pigmentation of the metanotum being round.
