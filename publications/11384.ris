N2 - We present an intramolecular reaction, Reflexâ„¢, to derive shorter, sequencer-ready, daughter polymerase chain reaction products from a pooled population of barcoded long-range polymerase chain reaction products, whilst still preserving the cognate DNA barcodes. Our Reflex workflow needs only a small number of primer extension steps to rapidly enable uniform sequence coverage of long contiguous sequence targets in large numbers of samples at low cost on desktop next-generation sequencers.
