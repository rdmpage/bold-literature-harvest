N2 - The complete mitochondrial genome of Bufo gargarizans was sequenced using overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons (GenBank Accession No. DQ275350). The genome is 17,277 base pairs in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes (ATP6, ATP8, COI-III, ND1-6, ND4L, Cyt b), 2 ribosomal RNAs (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA), 22 transfer RNAs and a putative control region. We analyzed the sequence using bioinformatics methods comparing the obtained mtDNA sequence with other toads and frogs. Based on the concatenated nucleotide sequences of protein-coding genes, we constructed a phylogenetic tree with maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) methods and discussed the phylogenetic relationships among 11 species of Anura.
