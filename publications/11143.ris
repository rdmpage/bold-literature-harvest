N2 - With the development of molecular identification, there has been a great deal of discussion about the feature of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments. Although longer fragments may minimize stochastic variation across taxa and be more likely to reflect broader patterns of nucleotide divergence, shorter fragments have many advantages, such as quick, easy and economical. Extensive application of long mtDNA segments for species identification cannot always be achieved as a result of constraints in time and money. In the present study, a molecular identification method involving the sequencing of a 272-bp ‘barcode’ fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from 55 specimens, representing 7 Chinese sarcophagid species from varying populations, was evaluated. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequenced segments showed that all sarcophagid specimens were properly assigned into seven species, which indicated the possibility of separation congeneric species with the short fragments. The results of this research will be instrumental for the implementation of the Chinese Sarcophagidae database.
