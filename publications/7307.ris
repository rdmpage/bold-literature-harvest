N2 - The recent surge of interest in DNA barcoding as a rapid method for species identification is reminiscent of some recent trends in phylogenetics in which computer-based methods such as maximum likelihood, Bayesianism, and super trees have swept through the systematics community, generating much excitement (Felsenstein 2004). Innovations in computer and nucleotide sequencing technologies have provided biologists of all sorts with a multitude of methodological options. The problem with such advances, however, is that one must beware of them becoming the force driving developments in a field at the expense of the philosophical foundations that form the basis for doing science and judging the merits of methods.
