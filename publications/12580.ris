N2 - Background: The genus Paralia Heiberg is one of the most recognizable, widely distributed and commonly
reported diatoms from contemporary coastal marine environments and ship ballast. Species discovery has
historically been made in diatoms through the recognition of morphological discontinuities between specimens,
first using light and later electron microscopy. However, recently, morphologically semi-cryptic species of Paralia
were delineated using genetic analyses, among mostly tropical and subtropical sites.
Results: Ten morphological characters of the frustules and sequence fragments from the nuclear genome
(conserved 18S regions of ribosomal RNA and the variable internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), and from the RuBisCo
large subunit (rbcL) gene of the chloroplast genome were examined. Frustule morphology did not segregate
species, however, comparisons of sequence fragments and ITS2 secondary structures yielded a new species from
North American waters, P. guyana (with four genodemes), and another widely-distributed species, P. marina. The
latter was lecto- and epitypified here because it is most similar to specimens in the type preparation BM1021
representing Smithâ€™s concept of the species. Paralia marina and certain genodemes of P. guyana were morphologically
cryptic. Only those genodemes of P. guyana that possess prickly separation valves could be morphologically
distinguished from P. marina with relative confidence in SEM preparations. All clones established from chains isolated
from the ballast sediment of the ships sailing along the Atlantic coast of North America belonged to P. guyana. All
DNA sequences of preserved Paralia chains recovered from the three trans-Atlantic voyages (TAVs) samples arriving to
eastern Canada from Europe shared 100% identity with P. marina.
Conclusion: First, if the x = 130592 P. marina cells per ballast tank at the end of the TAVs represents their abundance
in ballast tanks of similar crossings and following mid-ocean ballast water exchange, then this diatom, if de-ballasted,
exerts a strong and continued propagule pressure on Eastern Canadian coasts. Despite this, as of 2009, P. marina was
found only in Cheticamp, Nova Scotia, Canada. Second, genetic analysis readily segregated cryptic and semi-cryptic
taxa of Paralia, highlighting the usefulness of the molecular approach to species recognition, e.g., in programs
monitoring alien introductions.
