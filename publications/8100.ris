N2 - The Monopis monachella species complex from China is revised, and its relationship to other species complexes of the genus Monopis is discussed with reference to morphological, and molecular evidence. Principal component analysis on all available specimens provided supporting evidence for the existence of three species, one of which is described as new: Monopis iunctio Huang & Hirowatari sp. nov. All species are either diagnosed or described, and illustrated, and information is given on their distribution and host range. Additional information is given on the biology and larval stages of Monopis longella. A preliminary phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (CO1) sequence data and a key to the species of the M. monachella species complex in China is presented. The types of the new species have been deposited in the Institute of Entomology, Hunan Agricultural University, China and Entomological Laboratory, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan.
