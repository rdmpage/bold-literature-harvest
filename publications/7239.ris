N2 - Insects that vector pathogens are under constant surveillance in Australasia although the repertoire of genetic markers to distinguish what are often cryptic mosquito species remains limited. We present a comparative assessment of the second exonñintron region of the acetylcholine esterase 2 gene (ace-2) and the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) using two closely related Australasia mosquitoes Culex annulirostris and Culex palpalis. The COI revealed eight divergent lineages of which four were confirmed with the ace-2. We dissect out the nuclear chromosomal haplotypes of the ace-2 as well as the exonñintron regions by assessing the proteinís tertiary structure to reveal a hypervariable 5í-exon that forms part of an external protein loop and displays a higher polymorphic rate than the intron. We retrace the evolutionary history of these mosquitoes by phylogenetic inference and by testing different evolutionary hypotheses. We conclude that DNA barcoding using COI may overestimate the diversity of Culex mosquitoes in Australasia and should be applied cautiously with support from the nuclear DNA such as the ace-2. Together the COI and ace-2 provide robust evidence for distinct cryptic Culex lineagesóone of which correlates exactly with the southern limit of Japanese encephalitis virus activity in Australasia.
