N2 - Aphids of the subtribe Aphidina are found mainly in the North Temperate Zone. The relative lack of diagnostic morphological characteristics has hindered the identification of species in this group. However, DNA-based taxonomic methods can clarify species relationships within this group. Sequence variation in a partial segment of the mitochondrial COI gene was highly effective for identifying species within Aphidina. Thirty-six species of Aphidina were identified in a neighbor-joining tree. Mean intraspecific sequence divergence in Aphidina was 0.52%, with a range of 0.00% to 2.95%, and the divergences of most species were less than 1%. Mean interspecific divergence within previously recognized genera or morphologically similar species groups was 6.80%, with a range of 0.68% to 11.40%, with variation mainly in the range of 3.50% to 8.00%. Possible reasons for anomalous levels of mean nucleotide divergence within or between some taxa are discussed.
