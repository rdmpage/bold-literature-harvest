N2 - Here we report the first finding of Hypnea flexicaulis Yamagishi and Masuda in the Mediterranean Sea (Lagoon of Venice, Italy), identified through molecular analyses using the plastid ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) and the mitochondrial protein-coding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) genes. The phylogenetic reconstruction, based on rbcL + cox1 multiple alignment, showed that all specimens of H. flexicaulis from Venice, Korea, Philippines and Taiwan were included in a monophyletic group supported by a bootstrap value of 100%.

It is highly probable that H. flexicaulis has been introduced from Indo-Pacific populations, in particular the Korean one, probably via ship traffic or shellfish transfers.

The use of DNA barcoding combined with morphological observations was, in this case, a rapid way to identify this allochthonous species.
