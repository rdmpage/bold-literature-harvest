N2 - The scallop Placopecten magellanicus has the largest reported animal mitochondrial DNA (average 35 kb) and exhibits large inter- and intraindividual length variation owing to the varying copy number of a repeated element. We have characterized the repeat array by using restriction mapping and sequence analysis. The repeated element consists of 1,442 bp flanked on either side by the sequence ACTTTCC in a direct orientation. The array contains two to eight copies of the repeated element arranged in a direct orientation and in tandem. Only complete copies of the element are present in the array. The repeat element contains three regions with characteristic nucleotide sequences: a 10-bp inverted repeat shown to extrude into a cruciform in a supercoiled DNA plasmid, a 120-bp tract rich in G/C (70%) and adjacent to the inverted repeat, and periodically interspersed homopolymer runs of A and T occurring near the middle of the element which induce DNA curvature in dimeric constructs of the element. The element appears to be unique to P. magellanicus. The structural properties of the repeat element and its organization in an array of repeats may be important in explaining the generation and maintenance of large-scale mitochondrial DNA size variation observed in many animal species.
