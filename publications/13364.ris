N2 - A total of 114 insect specimens have been barcoded by this network of researchers, of which 24 sequences of Liriomyza sativae
Blanchard, a leafmining pest insect of vegetable crops, have been submitted to NCBI GenBank and to BOLD by the first author. This was a new species record for Bangladesh and was published in the online journal DNA Barcodes in 2014. Two researchers from the DU Aquaculture & Fisheries Department barcoded 17 species of aquatic organisms and submitted sequences to GenBank and BOLD. Additionally, one DU Zoology Departmentmember has barcoded nearly 80 species of freshwater fishes. Recently, a Professor from Jahangirnagar University received funding from the World Bank to research the diversity of insects through DNA barcoding.
