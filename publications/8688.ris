N2 - The biodiversity of tube-nosed bats (Murininae) from Asia has been underestimated by over 50%. Since 2005, eight taxa have been documented as distinct from the 19 previously known species. We describe three new species of Marina collected in southern China between 2004 and 2007. These species differ morphologically, morphometrically, and genetically from previously described species of Marina. Morphological differences include pelage color, size, skull shape and tooth morphology. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene supports species status based on divergent phylogenetic lineages.
