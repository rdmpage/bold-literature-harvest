N2 - The first complete mitochondrial genome for the Anostomidae fish family has been announced. Piracema fishes are the potamodromous migratory species from South America, which undergo lengthy and dramatic yearly reproductive upstream runs. The piracema species Leporinus piavussu has recently been described after a long misidentification history. Its mitogenome, assembled using NGS data and Sanger sequencing, consists in a 16,682â€‰bp circular molecule (GenBank accession number KM886569). The exact sequence and position of 37 mitochondrial genes and the control region is established. A possible case of heteroplasmy was found with NGS and corroborated by Sanger sequencing. These results will positively contribute to the debate about this group's taxonomy, evolution and conservation. [Epub ahead of print]
