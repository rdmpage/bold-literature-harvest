N2 - Sixteen species of cockroaches have been reported for Austria so far. This study is the first record of the parthenogenetic Surinam cockroach, Pycnoscelus surinamensis (L.) for Austria (and thus Central Europe). The species is natively distributed in Indo-Malaysia but has been unintentionally introduced in many, mainly tropical, countries throughout the world. Sequencing the DNA barcoding region revealed that all Austrian P. surinamensis samples had the same haplotype, which they shared with samples from the United States of America, Guyana and French Polynesia, indicating that all these samples/populations belong to the same clonal lineage. Even though in temperate regions, the occurrence of P. surinamensis is currently limited to green-houses, we advocate proper monitoring of the populations with respect to global warming and the expected increasing independence of this species from green-houses that comes along with it.
