N2 - In light of the recently described human schistosome Schistosoma guineensis and recent phylogenetic studies of the genus Schistosoma, a revision of the interrelationships of the members of this genus is needed. This paper adds to previous phylogenetic studies on the family Schistosomatidae and offers the most up to date and robust phylogeny of the group based on complete small and large nuclear subunit rRNA genes and partial mitochondrial cox1, incorporating most of the 21 species of Schistosoma. Our findings show that the group retains the same topology as that resolved in previous studies except Schistosoma margrebowiei was resolved as the sister taxon to all others in the Schistosoma haematobium species group and S. guineensis was placed as sister species to both Schistosoma bovis and Schistosoma curassoni. The S. haematobium species group contains eight species of which many are of significant medical and veterinary importance. Additionally, many of these species have been shown to hybridise both in the wild and experimentally, making the correct identification and recognition of species very important. A pairwise comparison of cox1 among Schistosoma species suggests this gene alone would fail as a reliable barcode for species identification. Phylogenetic results clearly treat Schistosoma intercalatum and S. guineensis as separate taxa with each more closely related evolutionarily to S. haematobium than to each other. The study also highlights the problems associated with wrongly attributed sequences on public databases such as GenBank.
