N2 - We describe a new species, Teutonia corsicana sp. nov. from Corsica, France using morphological data and DNA barcodes. Morphologically the new species can be separated on the basis of the female pregenital sclerite partially covered by genital flaps, and in both sexes a broad-based, triangular ventral projection of P-2 and slender P-3 (L/H ratio 1.6-1.7). The average K2P-distance between DNA-barcode sequences of T. corsicana sp. nov. and widely distributed T. cometes (Koch, 1837) was estimated at 18.7Â±1.9 %. An updated key for the European species of Teutonia is provided.
