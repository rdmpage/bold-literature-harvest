N2 - Background: The origin, evolution and speciation of the lion, has been subject of interest, debate and study. The
present surviving lions of the genus Panthera comprise of eight sub-species inclusive of Asiatic lion Panthera leo
persica of India's Gir forest. Except for the Asiatic lion, the other seven subspecies are found in different parts of
Africa. There have been different opinions regarding the phylogenetic status of Panthera leo, as well as classifying
lions of different geographic regions into subspecies and races. In the present study, mitogenome sequence of P.
leo persica deduced, using Ion Torrent PGM to assess phylogeny and evolution which may play an increasingly
important role in conservation biology.

Results: The mtDNA sequence of P. leo persica is 17,057 bp in length with 40.8% GC content. Annotation of
mitogenome revealed total 37 genes, including 13 protein coding, 2 rRNA and 22 tRNA. Phylogenetic analysis
based on whole mitogenome, suggests Panthera pardus as a neighbouring species to P. leo with species
divergence at ~2.96 mya.

Conclusion: This work presents first report on complete mitogenome of Panthera leo persica. It sheds light on the
phylogenetic and evolutionary status within and across Felidae members. The result compared and evaluated with
earlier reports of Felidae shows alteration of phylogenetic status and species evolution. This study may provide
information on genetic diversity and population stability.
