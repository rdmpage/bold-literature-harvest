N2 - OBJECTIVE:

The purpose of study was to discover the phylogenetic relations and plant barcoding of 17 plants from Huperziaceae.
METHODS:

Phylogenetic tree of chloroplast trnH-psbA gene of 17 plants from Huperziaceae was constructed by software.
RESULTS:

It showed that Huperziaceae could be divided into two genera Huperzia and Phlegmariurus and bootstrap value reached 91%.
CONCLUSIONS:

Holub and Qing' taxonomy was supported and 17 species in Huperziaceae were monophyletic groups and it suggested that trnH-psbA could be used as a DNA barcode to identify plants
