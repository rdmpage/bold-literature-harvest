N2 - Co-occurrence of double pathogenic mtDNA mutations with different claimed pathological roles in one mtDNA is infrequent. It is tentative to believe that each of these pathogenic mutations would have its own deleterious effect. Here we reported one three-generation Chinese family with a high penetrance of LHON (78.6%). Analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome in the proband revealed the presence of the LHON primary mutation G11778A in the NADH dehydrogenase 4 (ND4) gene and a deafness-associated mutation A1555G in the 12S rRNA gene. The other mtDNA variants in this family suggested a haplogroup status G2b. Although A1555G has long been confirmed to be a primary mutation for aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing loss, none of the maternally related members in this family showed hearing impairment. It thus seems that the occurrence of A1555G in this family had no pathological manifestation. However, whether A1555G has a synergistic effect with G11778A and contribute to the high penetrance of LHON remained an open question. To our knowledge, this is the first report that identified the co-existence of a deafness mutation A1555G and a primary LHON mutation G11778A in one family.
