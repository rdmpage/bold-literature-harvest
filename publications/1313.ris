N2 - The molecular evolution of the V6 and V9 domains of the mitochondrial SSU-rDNA was investigated to evaluate the use of these sequences for DNA barcodes in the Basidiomycota division. The PCR products from 27 isolates belonging to 11 Tricholoma species were sequenced. Both domains in the isolates belonging to the same species had identical sequences. All the species possess distinctive V9 sequences due to point mutations and insertion/deletion events. Secondary structures revealed that the insertion-deletion events occurred in regions not directly involved in the maintenance of the standard SSU-rRNA structure. The inserted sequences possess conserved motifs that enable their alignment among phylogenetically distant species. Hence, the V9 domain by displaying identical sequences within species, an adequate divergence level, easy amplification, and alignment represents an alternative molecular marker for the Basidiomycota division and opens the way for this sequence to be used as specific molecular markers of the fungal kingdom.
