N2 - The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule of the gorilla was sequenced. The entire sequence, 16,412 nucleotides, was determined by analysis of natural (not polymerase chain reaction) restriction fragments covering the whole molecule. The sequence was established from one individual and thus nonchimeric. After comparison with the COII gene of gorilla specimens with known geographical origin, the sequence was identified as characteristic of the Western lowland gorilla, Gorilla gorilla gorilla. With the exception of the NADH2 gene, all genes have a methionine start codon. The inferred start codon of NADH2 is ATT (isoleucine). The COIII, NASDH4, and cytochrome b genes are not terminated by a stop codon triplet, and the COI gene is probably terminated by an AAA triplet rather than by a regular stop codon. The great majority of genic sequences (rRNAs, peptide-coding genes, tRNAs) of the complete mtDNAs of Gorilla, Pan, and Homo show a greater similarity between Pan and Homo than between either of these genera to Gorilla. The analysis of the peptide-coding genes suggest that relative to comparison between Homo and Pan a certain degree of transition saturation has taken place in codon position 3 in comparisons between Gorilla to either Homo or Pan.
