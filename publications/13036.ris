N2 - Background: Inventorying the resident biodiversity of protected areas takes substantial resources and time, but DNA barcoding has proven a useful tool to reduce this investment, particularly in hyperdiverse taxa and biomes. A survey of the diversity of Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) occurring in the 4000 ha private conservation area, Mogale’s Gate Biodiversity Centre (MGBC), was initiated in 2012 and has employed DNA barcoding to accelerate its completion. Results: Over 5000 specimens have been collected from various grassland and savanna sites within the reserve, primarily during the Forum Herbulot conference, in just five collecting nights, 13–17 February 2012. Individual participants morphologically identified their personal collections of the site. A subset of these specimens, including many undetermined taxa, were assigned taxonomy through DNA barcoding and then combined with individual lists for compilation of a master checklist. DNA barcode sequences were recovered from 4179 (98.8%) individuals, representing 47 families and 1003 putative species or Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). Nearly half (457) of the BINs were unique to the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), and just over one third (365) were assigned to a species once the barcodes were queried against BOLD. Significance: Our study provides a valuable evaluation of an approach for assessing the alpha diversity of a hyperdiverse taxon, which suffers from incomplete taxonomy. The ability to accurately assess the diversity of such taxa in protected areas is vitally important for proper conservation, land use planning, and management.
