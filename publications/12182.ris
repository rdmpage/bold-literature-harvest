N2 - We describe a microarray-based screen performed by imposing different genetic selections on thousands of yeast mutants in parallel, representing most genes in the yeast genome. The presence or absence of mutants was detected by oligonucleotide arrays that hybridize to 20-nucleotide “barcodes.” We used this method to screen for components of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Known components of the pathway were identified, as well as a gene not previously known to be involved in NHEJ, NEJ1. Nej1 protein interacts with the amino terminus of LIF1/XRCC4, a recently recognized “guardian of the genome” against cancer.
