N2 - Debuting to considerable fanfare in 2002, Mantophasmatodea (gladiators) was the first new insect order to be erected in a century (Klass et al., 2002). Originally discovered as fossils in Baltic amber (Zompro, 2001), live mantophasmids were originally found in Namibia (Klass et al., 2002) and subsequently South Africa (Picker et al., 2002). More interesting than their status as a living-fossil, however, is the proposal that mantophasmids represent a new insect order. Since the insect orders represent the major divisions in body form and life history that make up insect diversity proposing a new insect order would mean a major addition to insect diversity and therefore need a high level of justification. The paper erecting the order Mantophasmatodea did not include a rigorous assessment of the group's phylogenetic relationships, but rather focused on their unique morphology and the authors' difficulty in placing it in any extant insect group. This has lead to questions at to whether mantophasmids deserve ordinal status or if they are not simply highly derived members of another insect order (e.g., Tilgner, 2002); indeed the ordinal name itself points to similarities to both praying mantises (Mantodea) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). Attempts to clarify the issue with diverse datasets including gut morphology (Klass et al., 2002), sperm (Dallai et al., 2003), and genitalic characters (Klass et al., 2003) have suggested affinities with Grylloblattodea, Mantodea, and Phasmatodea, respectively, but none of these results were definitive. A more recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of polyneopterous insect orders supported
