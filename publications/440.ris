N2 - We used partial sequences of three mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, cytochrome b, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) to reconstruct the phylogeny of European seed beetles (Bruchidae) belonging to the genera Bruchus Linnaeus and Bruchidius Schilsky. Adult beetles examined in this study were obtained from larvae bred from seeds directly collected in the field. Parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among species. Both genera, Bruchidius and Bruchus, formed monophyletic groups in all analyses. Our results were partially in discrepancy with existing taxonomic groups (Borowiec, 1987). Critical analysis of relationships among taxa, and exhaustive review of host-plants data highlight the very high level of specialization of these seed beetles. Phylogenetically related insects were associated with host-plants belonging to the same botanical tribes.
