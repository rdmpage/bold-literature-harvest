N2 - The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Gampsocleis gratiosa was determined. The 15,929 bp in the size of G. gratiosa mitogenome contains a typical gene content, base composition, and codon usage found in metazoan. All 13 protein coding genes (PCGs) of the G. gratiosa mitogenome start with a typical ATN codon. The usual termination codons (TAA and TAG) were found from 10 PCGs. However, the atp6, nad4, and nad5 had incomplete termination codon (T). The anticodons of all tRNAs are identical to those observed in Drosophila yakuba and Locusta migratoria, and can be folded in the form of a typical clover leaf structure except for trnS (AGN). The secondary structure of trnS (AGN) was drawn according with the Steinberg-Cedergren tertiary structure. The A+T content (67.4%) of the A+T-rich region is relatively lower among the mitogenome regions, in contrast, it usually contains the highest A+T content for most insects. Two isolated sequence repeat regions (202 bp) were found in the A+T-rich region with mapping and secondary structure information.
