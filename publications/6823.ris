N2 - The phylogenetic relationships of 13 snapper species from the South China Sea have been established using the combined
DNA sequences of three full-length mitochondrial genes (COI, COII and CYTB) and two partial nuclear genes (RAG1, RAG2).
The 13 species (genus Lutjanus) were selected after DNA barcoding 72 individuals, representing 20 species. Our study suggests
that although DNA barcoding aims to develop species identification systems, it may also be useful in the construction of
phylogenies by aiding the selection of taxa. Combined mitochondrial and nuclear gene data has an advantage over an individual
dataset because of its higher resolving power.
