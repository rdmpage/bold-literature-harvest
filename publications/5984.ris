N2 - The scope of the present research was to initiate and apply DNA barcoding in Greek freshwater fish species aiming to reveal new approaches on their protection and sustainable management as well as unmask look-alikes to prevent falsification. In the present study DNA barcoding was carried out in a total of 141 individuals, representing 18 fish species from both lakes Doirani and Volvi (Northern Greece). A 655bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1) was sequenced using universal primers. Average within-species, -family and -order Kimura two parameter (K2P) distances were 0.41%, 14.9% and 15.6% respectively. All species could be differentiated by their cox1 sequence. Barcoded common species from both lakes had lake-specific haplotypes, indicating that location-based discrimination of species is possible. After constructing neighbor joining phylogenetic trees, the clades revealed generally corresponded well with expectations. Our study supports previous studies on the conclusion that cox1 sequencing, or ‘barcoding’, can be used to identify fish species.
