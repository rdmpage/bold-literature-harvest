N2 - The mt genome of Paa spinosa (Anura: Ranoidae) is a circular molecule of 18,012 bp in length, containing 38 genes (including an extra copy of tRNA-Met gene). This mt genome is characterized by three distinctive features: a cluster of rearranged tRNA genes (LTPF tRNA gene cluster), a tandem duplication of tRNA-Met gene (Met1 and Met2), and distinct repeat regions at both 5' and 3'-sides in the control region. Comparing the locations and the sequences of all tRNA-Met genes among Ranoidae, and constructing NJ tree of the nucleotide of those tRNA-Met genes, we suggested a tandem duplication of tRNA-Met gene can be regarded as a synapomorphy of Dicroglossinae. To further investigate the phylogenetic relationships of anurans, phylogenetic analyses (BI, ML and MP) based on the nucleotide dataset and the corresponding amino acid dataset of 11 protein-coding genes (except ND5 and ATP8) arrived at the similar topology.
