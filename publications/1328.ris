N2 - Modern approaches in DNA-based species identification are considered. Long used methods of species identification in procaryotes (G+C ratio, 16S rRNA nucleotide sequence, DNA-DNA hybridization) have recently been supplemented by the method of multilocus sequence analysis based on comparison of nucleotide sequences of fragments of several genes. Species identification in eukaryotes also employs one or two standard short fragments of the genome (known as DNA-barcodes). Potential benefits of new approaches and some difficulties during their practical realization are discussed.
