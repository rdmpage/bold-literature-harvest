N2 - Diversification in phytophagous insects is often attributed to a propensity toward specialization and to a tendency for speciation to be associated with host-shifts. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a sister relationship between the generalist Stator limbatus and the specialist host-shifted Stator beali, providing a system to examine the genealogical and geographic origins of the main processes involved in this diversification: host-shifts, specialization, and reproductive isolation. We examine the interspecific phylogeographic relationships between these species using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. S. beali is derived within S. limbatus, rendering the latter paraphyletic and suggesting a budding process of speciation. The inherent polarity in this genealogical pattern indicates that the specialist habit, clumping oviposition behavior, and distinct genitalia of S. beali are all derived from the ancestral S. limbatus. The phylogeography of S. limbatus also shows strong geographic structure with divergences corresponding to known biogeographic boundaries, indicating that this evolutionary signal has not been erased by the vagaries of history. However, the derivation of S. beali and the evolution of reproductive isolation between the two species does not correspond to these known biogeographic boundaries, as S. beali and its sister clade of S. limbatus are restricted to the same geographic province. The geographic proximity of diversification combined with a divergence time estimated at the beginning of the Pleistocene indicates that speciation likely occurred very rapidly, although further genetic and ecological work is necessary to examine the mode of speciation. This study provides the historical context for ongoing evolutionary, ecological, and quantitative genetic research on the divergence in diet breadth between these species.
