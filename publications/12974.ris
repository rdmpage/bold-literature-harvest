N2 - Background: Engaging students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) has become a major priority for educators. As STEM-based careers emerge and define a global shift in innovation, the need for hands-on STEM-oriented activities for educational purposes becomes clear. DNA barcoding, through early studies, has been shown to be an effective activity for STEM education. The application of DNA barcoding combines knowledge from biodiversity, genomics, and bioinformatics fields in a cost-effective way, enabling its use in education. BOLD Systems now provides some of the infrastructure necessary to make this technology accessible in supporting both teacher-led and independent education. We discuss the tools developed by BOLD for this purpose and provide examples on their use. Results: Many students and citizen scientists have expressed an interest in contributing to the DNA barcoding initiative via the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) Systems, a dedicated platform developed for DNA barcoding. However, this platform is targeted at professional scientists and post-graduate students due to the complexity of interfaces and assumed subject matter experience from users. This limitation is addressed through two other systems, the BOLD Student Data Portal (BOLD-SDP) and LifeScanner. BOLD-SDP was developed based on the scientific barcoding workflow but with greatly simplified interfaces targeting high-school and undergraduate classrooms. This portal supports teacher-led research projects involving the generation of DNA barcodes. A key aspect of this system is that results of classroom experiments lead to novel data being contributed to the BOLD database and GenBank. SDP provides special tools for instructors to support the monitoring and publishing of student work. Since its activation in 2013, BOLD-SDP has been used by over 200 instructors and 4000 students from 10 countries. The LifeScanner mobile identification tool was developed in part to support independent barcodebased research by users of any age. LifeScanner consists of mobile software that provides a very simple interface to BOLD and specimen collection kits that enable to acquisition of DNA barcodes and barcode-based species identifications. Significance: By equipping students and educators with technology and the support framework to implement programs, BOLD exposes students to new technologies that increase their understanding and interest in STEM careers.
