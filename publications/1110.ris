N2 - Distinct gender-associated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages (i.e., lineages which are transmitted either through males or through females) have been demonstrated in two families of bivalves, the Mytilidae (marine mussels) and the Unionidae (freshwater mussels), which have been separated for more than 400 Myr. The mode of transmission of these M (for male-transmitted) and F (for female-transmitted) molecules has been referred to as doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI), in contrast to standard maternal inheritance (SMI), which is the norm in animals. A previous study suggested that at least three origins of DUI are required to explain the phylogenetic pattern of M and F lineages in freshwater and marine mussels. Here we present phylogenetic evidence based on partial sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and the 16S RNA gene that indicates the DUI is a dynamic phenomenon. Specifically, we demonstrate that F lineages in three species of Mytilus mussels, M. edulis, M. trossulus, and M. californianus, have spawned separate lineages which are now associated only with males. This process is referred to as "masculinization" of F mtDNA. By extension, we propose that DUI may be a primitive bivalve character and that periodic masculinization events combined with extinction of previously existing M types effectively reset the time of divergence between conspecific gender-associated mtDNA lineages.
