N2 - DNA sequence comparisons of 12S, 16S, and COI mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among 8 species of Triatoma [7 belonging to the infestans complex and T. circummaculata (Stål), a member of a different complex based on morphology]. There was remarkable mtDNA similarity between T. infestans (Klug) and T. platensis Neiva that can be explained by mtDNA introgression. Evolutionary trees were constructed using Panstrongylus megistus (Burmeister) as the outgroup. This outgroup gave evidence that the root of the group would be between T. vitticeps (Stål) and the rest of the species. The placement of T. circummaculata into the middle of the infestans complex is not consistent with the morphological classification, suggesting that the current systematics of this group does not reflect phylogenetic affinities.
