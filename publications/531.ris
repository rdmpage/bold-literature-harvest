N2 - We isolated Korean soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis, mitochondrial DNA by long-polymerase chain reaction (long-PCR) with conserved primers and sequenced this mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) with primer walking using flanking sequences. The P. sinensis mitochondrial DNA has 17,042 bp and its structural organization is conserved compared to those of other reptiles and mammals. To unveil the phylogenetic relationship of the turtles, we used the NJ, MP, and ML analysis methods after inferring those sequences from the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. We also compared two P. sinensis variants from Korea and China using the mitochondrial genome. In this study, we report the basic characteristics of the P. sinensis mitochondrial genome, including structural organization and base composition of the rRNAs, tRNAs and protein-coding genes, as well as characteristics of tRNAs. These features are applicable for the study of phylogenetic relationships in turtles.
