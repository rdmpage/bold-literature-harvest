N2 - The Human Genome Project, from one perspective, began in 1981 with the publication1 of the complete sequence of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The Cambridge reference sequence (CRS), as it is now designated, continues to be indispensable for studies of human evolution, population genetics andmitochondrial diseases. It has been recognized for some time, however, that the CRS differs at several sites from the mtDNA sequences obtained by other investigators2, 3. These discrepancies may reflect either true errors in the original sequencing analysis or rare polymorphisms in the CRS mtDNA. A further complication is that the original mtDNA sequence was principally derived from a single individual of European descent, although it also contained some sequences from both HeLa and bovine mtDNA (1). To resolve these uncertainties, we have completely resequenced the original placental mtDNA sample.
