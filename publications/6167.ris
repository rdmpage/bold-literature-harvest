N2 - Recent molecular studies addressing the phylogenetic relationships of avian orders have had conflicting results. While studies using nuclear DNA sequences tend to support traditional taxonomic views, also supported by morphological data [(paleognaths (galloanseres (all other birds)))], with songbirds forming a clade within Neoaves (all other birds), analyses with complete mtDNA genomes have resulted in topologies that place songbirds as one of the earliest-diverging avian lineages. Considering that over half of the extant bird species are songbirds, these different results have very different implications for our understanding of avian evolution. We analyzed data sets comprising nearly 4 kb of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (complete 12S, ND1, ND2, and cytochrome b) plus 600 bp of the nuclear gene c-mos for 15 birds that were chosen to represent all major avian clades and to minimize potential long-branch attraction problems; we used a partition-specific maximum likelihood approach. Our results show congruence with respect to the ingroup among phylogenies obtained with mtDNA and the nuclear gene c-mos, separately or combined. The data sets support a traditional avian taxonomy, with paleognaths (ratites and tinamous) occupying a basal position and with songbirds more derived and forming a monophyletic group. We also show that, for mtDNA studies, turtles may be a better outgroup for birds than crocodilians because of their slower rate of sequence evolution.
