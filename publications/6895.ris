N2 - DNA barcoding using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) is regarded as a standard method for species identification. Recent reports have also shown extended applications of COI gene analysis in phylogeny and molecular diversity studies. The bee-eaters are a group of near passerine birds in the family Meropidae. There are 26 species worldwide; five of them are found in Saudi Arabia. Until now, GenBank included a COI barcode for only one species of bee-eater, the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster). We sequenced the 694-bp segment of the COI gene of the green bee-eater M. orientalis and compared the sequences with those of M. apiaster. Pairwise sequence comparison showed 66 variable sites across all the eight sequences from both species, with an interspecific genetic distance of 0.0362. Two and one within-species variable sites were found, with genetic distances of 0.0005 and 0.0003 for M. apiaster and M. orientalis, respectively. This is the first study reporting barcodes for M. orientalis.
