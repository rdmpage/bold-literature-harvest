N2 - The Afrotropical fruit fly genus Ceratitis MacLeay is an economically important group that comprises over 89 species, subdivided into six subgenera. Cladistic analyses of morphological and host use characters have produced several phylogenetic hypotheses for the genus. Only monophyly of the subgenera Pardalaspis and Ceratitis (sensu stricto) and polyphyly of the subgenus Ceratalaspis are common to all of these phylogenies. In this study, the hypotheses developed from morphological and host use characters are tested using gene trees produced from DNA sequence data of two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase I and NADH-dehydrogenase subunit 6) and a nuclear gene (period). Comparison of gene trees indicates the following relationships: the subgenus Pardalaspis is monophyletic, subsection A of the subgenus Pterandrus is monophyletic, the subgenus Pterandrus may be either paraphyletic or polyphyletic, the subgenus Ceratalaspis is polyphyletic, and the subgenus Ceratitis s. s. might not be monophyletic. In addition, the genera Ceratitis and Trirhithrum do not form reciprocally monophyletic clades in the gene trees. Although the data statistically reject monophyly for Trirhithrum under the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, they do not reject monophyly of Ceratitis.
