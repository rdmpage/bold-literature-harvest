N2 - The biosphere is so extraordinarily diverse that methodical cataloguing of biodiversity by traditional methods might never provide a complete ‘species list’ for the planet [1]. This realization, coupled with real controversy over both how to define and how to diagnose ‘species’ [2], has led to proposals for a molecular taxonomy based on a defined part of the genome [3, 4 and 5]. We would like to emphasize, from our practical experience [6], some of the features of a molecular taxon system that we hope will dispel the fears of more morphologically inclined taxonomists.
