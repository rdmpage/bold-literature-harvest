N2 - Correct taxonomy is a prerequisite for biological research, but currently it is undergoing a serious crisis, resulting
in the neglect of many highly diverse groups of organisms. In nematodes, species delimitation remains problematic
due to their high morphological plasticity. Evolutionary approaches using DNA sequences can potentially overcome
the problems caused by morphology, but they are also affected by theoretical flaws. A holistic approach with a
combination of morphological and molecular methods can therefore produce a straightforward delimitation of
species. The present study investigates the taxonomic status of some highly divergent mitochondria1 haplotypes in
the Rhabditis (Pellioditis) marina species complex by using a combination of molecular and morphological tools.
We used three molecular markers (COI, ITS, D2D3) and performed phylogenetic analyses. Subsequently, morphometric
data from nearly all lineages were analysed with multivariate techniques. We included R. (P) mediterranea
and R. (R.) nidrosiensis to infer species status of the observed lineages. The results showed that highly divergent
genotypic clusters were accompanied by morphological differences, and we created a graphical polytomous key for
future identifications. This study indisputably demonstrates that R. (P) marina and R. (l?) mediterranea belong
to a huge species complex and that biodiversity in free-living marine nematodes may be seriously underestimated.
