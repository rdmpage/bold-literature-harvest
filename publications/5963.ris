N2 - The biodiversity of soil communities remains very poorly known and understood. Soil biological
sciences are strongly affected by the taxonomic crisis, and most groups of animals in that biota suffer from a
strong taxonomic impediment. The objective of this work was to investigate how DNA barcoding – a novel
method using a microgenomic tag for species identifi cation and discrimination – permits better evaluation of
the taxonomy of soil biota. A total of 1,152 barcode sequences were analyzed for two major groups of animals,
collembolans and earthworms, which presented broad taxonomic and geographic sampling. Besides strongly
refl ecting the taxonomic impediment for both groups, with a large number of species-level divergent lineages
remaining unnamed so far, the results also highlight a high level (15%) of cryptic diversity within known
species of both earthworms and collembolans. These results are supportive of recent local studies using a
similar approach. Within an impeded taxonomic system for soil animals, DNA-assisted identifi cation tools
can facilitate and improve biodiversity exploration and description. DNA-barcoding campaigns are rapidly
developing in soil animals and the community of soil biologists is urged to embrace these methods.
