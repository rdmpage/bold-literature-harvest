N2 - Itajahya galericulata (Phallales, Phallaceae) was previously reported from
several countries in South America and Africa. Recently we found I. galericulata in the
city of Vadodara, Gujarat State, India. To verify its identity we studied its morphology and
performed molecular phylogenetic analyses using nuclear rDNA LSU and mitochondrial
ATP6 loci. Here we also provide nuclear rDNA ITS sequences for the Indian collection,
since up to now no sequences of this region have been available for I. galericulata in
GenBank. This study furnishes the first evidence for the occurrence of I. galericulata in
India and in Asia as a whole
