N2 - Elevational diversity patterns can reflect the responses of biodiversity to climate change
spatially. We investigate the species diversity patterns of green lacewings (an important
predatory group of insects) along the gradient of elevation from the Shaluli Mountains
(Mts. Shaluli), which belong to the Hengduan Mountains in southwestern China, one
of the important hotspots of global biodiversity. We combined multiple approaches,
including Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), Assemble Species by Automatic
Partitioning analysis (ASAP), General Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC), Poisson tree
processes (bPTP), multi-rate Poisson tree processes (mPTP), to delimit the green
lacewings species based on the standard barcoding region of cytochrome c oxidase
subunit I (COI). The α-diversity and β-diversity patterns of green lacewings from the
Mts. Shaluli along the gradient of elevation were analyzed, with further exploration
on how the temperature effect elevational-diversity pattern on broad-scale (county
scale) elevational gradients. The DNA barcoding reference library consisted of 40 green
lacewing species from the Mts. Shaluli. The α-diversity of green lacewings decreased
with the increasing elevation. The temperature was found to have a significant effect on
the abundance and Shannon-Wiener diversity index but not on the species richness.
Nestedness replaced turnover as the main component of Sørensen’s dissimilarity with
the increasing elevation, and greater nestedness occurred at low temperature areas.
The combination of a reliable DNA barcoding database could improve the accuracy and
efficiency to investigate the species diversity patterns of green lacewings. Temperature,
resource, and resultant interspecific competitions may have important roles in explaining
the species diversity patterns of green lacewings from the Mts. Shaluli. Priority of
conservation should be given to the species at low elevation, middle elevation, and
relatively high temperature regions under the background of global climate warming
