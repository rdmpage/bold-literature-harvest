N2 - Eriocheir japonica sinensis has long been regarded as a fashionable dainty in China and other Asian countries for its good taste and rich nutrition. The largest and most economically important mitten crab belongs to E. j. sinensis. But now, E. j. sinensis resource has been intermixed with E. j. hepuensis, which is similar to E. j. sinensis in morphology. In addition, the germplasm resource will be declining rapidly for the two subspeciesâ€™ intermixture. Development of pure E. j. sinensis breed will be a dominant topic in future aquaculture. Molecular markers including DNA bar coding are stable and less affected by external environment, and have been widely used for the discrimination of species or subspecies. In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of two gene sequences were analyzed, and 17 stably variable sites were confirmed in Cytb and 11 sites in COI sequences, which might be used as the specific DNA bar coding of the two subspecies. Then, two pairs of diagnostic primers (P1F/P1R, P2F/P2R) on stably variable sites were designed and proved to be valid in E. j. sinensis germplasm authentication for future aquaculture and could be extended for application of identification in food industry.
