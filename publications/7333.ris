N2 - A total of 123 Trichoderma strains were isolated from Norwegian surface-sourced drinking
water. The water samples included raw water, treated water, and water from private homes
and hospital installations. Trichoderma species are difficult to differentiate morphologically,
but recent molecular identification tools, including DNA barcoding, successfully distinguish
between closely related species. The diversity of Trichoderma spp. was explored by DNA
sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and translation elongation factor 1 alpha
(TEF-1&#945;). Sequence identification was performed in the TrichOKEY version 2.0 barcode
program and in the multilocus similarity search database TrichoBLAST, combined with
traditional BLAST searches in the EMBL/GenBank. A total of 11 known Trichoderma/Hypocrea
species were identified. In addition, one group of unidentified Trichoderma strains was found
to represent a separate, strongly supported subclade within the Pachybasium ‘A’/Hamatum
clade, based on their TEF-1&#945; haplotypes. Trichoderma viride comprised 49% of the identified
strains, and was represented by four and eight slightly different ITS and TEF-1&#945; haplotypes,
respectively. Approximately 22% of the surface-derived water samples were positive for
T. viride, and the species was frequently isolated throughout the surface-sourced drinking
water distribution system. The results indicate that a broad range of Trichoderma species
are present in Norwegian surface-sourced drinking. Water treatment has minor effect in
removing Trichoderma from raw water, and active growth in the water distribution system
is likely to occur.
