N2 - The complete mitochondrial genome of the yellowfin seabream Acanthopagrus latus was determined in the present study. The genome was 16,609 bp in length and contained 37 genes (2 ribosomal RNA, 22 transfer RNA and 13 protein-coding genes) and the control region (CR), with the content and order of genes being similar to those in typical teleosts. Comparisons of the 37 genes and CR among species indicate the CR was the highest divergent (0.3341), but tRNAGly possesses the lowest genetic variation (0.0542). Much greater p-genetic distances [mean = 0.1559, standard deviation (SD) = 0.0235; n = 1653] for the interspecies level with high frequency (99.4%) than those of the intraspecies level (mean = 0.0098, SD = 0.0090; n = 20) were inferred from 212 Cyt b sequence data, suggesting the Cyt b gene is conserved within Sparidae species and supporting the barcoding validity of Cyt b sequence data for Sparidae species identification. Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding genes supported that the genus Pagrus was not monophyletic, showing the need to re-evaluate the morphological characteristics of Pagrus fishes.
