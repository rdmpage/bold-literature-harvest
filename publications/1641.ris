N2 - Iksookimia choii (Teleostei; Cypriniformes; Cobitidae) is an endangered freshwater fish species because of anthropogenic pressures around its natural habitats. We present the complete mitogenome sequence of L. choii to provide baseline data for use in the development of conservation plans and captive breeding programs. The total size, gene content and arrangement, and cloverleaf secondary structures of transfer RNA genes of I. choii mitogenome were highly homogeneous to previously known vertebrate mitogenomes. Phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences of protein-coding and transfer RNA genes reflected the taxonomic clustering in the familial levels among species of the superfamily Cobitoidea. I. choii, which was recently transferred to the newly erected genus Iksookimia from Cobitis, was phylogenetically affiliated to one of two Cobitis species with strong statistical supports, indicating its taxonomically unstable status.
