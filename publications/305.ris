N2 - Recent development of a PCR-based approach for sequencing vertebrate mitochondrial genomes has attracted much attention as being more rapid and economical than traditional methods using cloned mtDNA and primer walking. Such a method has not been available for insect mitochondrial genomes, despite widespread use of them for the molecular phylogenetic, biogeographical and population genetic markers. A recently developed PCR-based approach for sequencing whole mitochondrial genomes of decapod crustaceans, which included the design of many versatile PCR primers for the latter, was applied with the same primers sets to mitochondrial genomes of two insects, smoky-brown cockroach Periplaneta fuliginosa (Serville, 1839) and skimmer dragonfly Orthetrum triangulare melania (Selys, 1883). Almost the entire region of the two mitochondrial genomes was successfully sequenced. Features of the two mitochondrial genomes are described and the usefulness of this PCR-based approach for sequencing insect mitochondrial genomes demonstrated.
