N2 - Forensic entomology aids the determination of post mortem interval based on arthropods associated with a deceased
body. This relies on the accurate identification of insects that visit the body, particularly first colonisers such as Calliphoridae
(Diptera). Traditional species identification though morphological keys can be challenging as immature or closely related
specimens can look similar. Some of these challenges have been overcome through “DNA barcoding”, which involves the
sequencing of informative regions within a species’ DNA and comparison to a database of reference sequences. However,
reference DNA sequences of blow fly species in South Africa is currently limited. In this study, adult blow flies representing four
species common to the Western Cape, South Africa (Chrysomya chloropyga, Chrysomya albiceps, Chrysomya marginalis, Lucilia sericata)
were examined using morphological keys and DNA barcoding of two regions: COI and ITS2. These DNA sequences were then used
as references for the successful identification of seven unknown immature specimens. Intraspecific divergence showed a
maximum of 0.36% and 2.25% for COI and ITS2, respectively; interspecific divergence showed a minimum of 6.14% and 64.6% for
COI and ITS2, respectively. According to these results, COI and ITS2 have sufficient discriminatory power for species-level
identification for the four species studied.
