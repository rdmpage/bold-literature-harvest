N2 - Nucleotide sequences from 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) were used to examine phylogenetic relationships and evolution of beetles from the tribe Hololeptini (Coleoptera: Histeridae: Histerinae) that inhabit necrotic tissue of columnar cacti in the Sonoran Desert. Phylogenetic and morphological analyses revealed the presence of seven separate lineages, three representing species in the genus Iliotona, including I. beyeri stat. nov., and four species belonging to the genus Hololepta (sensu lato). The possible roles of historical vicariance and host plant associations on the evolution of the Hololeptini from the Sonoran Desert are discussed.
