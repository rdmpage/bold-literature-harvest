N2 - The issue of mitochondrial heteroplasmy has been cited as a theoretical problem for DNA barcoding but is only beginning to be examined in natural systems. We sequenced multiple DNA extractions from 20 individuals of four Hawaiian Hylaeus bee species known to be heteroplasmic. All species showed strong differences at polymorphic sites between abdominal and muscle tissue in most individuals, and only two individuals had no obvious segregation. Two specimens produced completely clean sequences from abdominal DNA. The fact that these differences are clearly visible by direct sequencing indicates that substantial intra-individual mtDNA diversity may be overlooked when DNA is taken from small tissue fragments. At the same time, differences in haplotype distribution among individuals may result in incorrect recognition of cryptic species. Because DNA barcoding studies typically use only a small fragment of an organism, they are particularly vulnerable to sequencing bias where heteroplasmy and haplotype segregation are present. It is important to anticipate this possibility prior to undertaking large-scale barcoding projects to reduce the likelihood of haplotype segregation confounding the results.
