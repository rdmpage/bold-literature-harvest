N2 - Two new species of Hemileucinae are described from the region of Muzo (Boyaca department) in the Eastern Cordillera
of Colombia. Leucanella bonillensis, new species, is a small greyish species whose closest relatives are L. newmani
(Lemaire) and L. acutissima (Walker). It can be distinguished from those two species by several subtle differences in
wing pattern and coloration as well as a few characters of the male genitalia, which are overall very conserved within the
genus. Cerodirphia zulemae, new species, belongs to the very uniform species-group of C. speciosa (Cramer), characterised
by a pink ground colour and the presence of a “Y”-shaped discal mark on the forewing. Based on its male genitalia,
the new species is related to C. brunnea (Draudt) and C. apunctata Dias & Lemaire. It may be distinguished from the
former by its more vivid ground colour, but detailed examination of the male genitalia are necessary to differentiate it
from C. apunctata. Colour pictures of the habitus of the new species and their relatives are provided, and their genital
structures are figured as well, including both sexes for C. zulemae. We also provide additional support to these descriptions
based on genetic data obtained in the context of a global DNA barcoding campaign recently initiated for saturniid
moths. Both L. bonillensis and C. zulemae are unambiguously distinguished from closest relatives based on genetic distances
(no intraspecific distances in either case; interspecific distance ranges 5.6–6.6% and 6.7–12.5%, respectively) and
inference of phylogenetic hypotheses based on partial sequences of the COI mitochondrial gene. These results emphasize
the potential of DNA barcoding to support taxonomic work in species-groups considered difficult to address through
morphology.
