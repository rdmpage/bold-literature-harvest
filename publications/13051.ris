N2 - Pollination is an ecosystem function of global importance. However, who visits the flower of specific plants, how the composition of visitors varies in space and in time, and how such variation translates into pollination services is typically hard to establish. Given their enormous diversity, flower-visiting arthropods are simply hard to tally, let alone to describe in terms of other aspects of diversity. To clarify regional variation in the pollinator community of a circumpolar flower resource, we compared the structure of the arthropod community pollinating Dryas spp. across 14 sites of the Northern hemisphere. In a distributed experiment, pollinators were sampled with 100 sticky flower mimics at each site. At one site in north-east Greenland, spatiotemporal resolution was added by replicated sampling at 15 locations within a valley. All insects caught were identified to species level using a partial sequence of the mitochondrial COI gene, and diversity patterns described by both Barcode Index Number (BIN)-level richness and by phylogenetic estimates of diversity. Results: Across the Arctic, we sampled a total of 13 826 arthropods visiting sticky Dryas mimics. Of these arthropods, we successfully sequenced and identified 11 229 individuals, detecting a total of 1288 different BINs. At the time of writing, we are frantically comparing patterns of species turnover, phylogenetic diversity, and BIN richness across the Arctic, with results to be reported at the conference in November. Significance: DNA barcodes allow us to overcome the taxonomic impediment, and to address ecological patterns involving thousands of taxa, each of which are hard to identify. DNA barcodes also contain (some) information on species relatedness, thus allowing us to simultaneously assess how phylogenetically diverse communities are formed on a single plant resource under different biogeographic and abiotic conditions. Taken together, this information offers unparalleled insights into community assembly processes in space and in time, with direct implications for ecosystem functioning.
