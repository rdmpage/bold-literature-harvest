N2 - We tested the efficiency of cytochrome oxidase I (COI)-barcoding as a taxonomic tool to discriminate and identify sympatric shrew species on Mount Nimba (Guinea). We identiﬁed 148 specimens at the species level using morphological characters and comparison with type specimens, including several taxa from Mount Nimba. We identiﬁed ten morphospecies and tested aspects of genetic diversity and monophyly using genetic data from three mitochondrial (16S, cytochrome b, and COI) and one nuclear marker (the breast cancer gene, BRCA). Nine
morphospecies were validated under the phylogenetic and genetic species concepts, including the recently diverged species Crocidura buettikoferi, Crocidura theresae, and Crocidura grandiceps. Under the same concepts, our analyses revealed the presence of two cryptic species amongst animals identiﬁed as Crocidura muricauda. We then
tested the efficiency of barcoding thanks to commonly used phenetic methods, with the 148 specimens representing 11 potentially valid species based on morphological and molecular data. We show that COI-barcoding is a powerful tool for shrew identiﬁcation and can be used for taxonomic surveys. The comparison of genetic divergence values
shows the presence of a barcoding gap (i.e. difference between the highest intraspeciﬁc and the lowest interspeciﬁc genetic divergence values). Given that only a few COI sequences are available for Afrotropical shrews, our work is an important step forward toward their enrichment. We also tested the efficiency of the three other sequenced
markers and found that cytochrome b is as efficient as COI for barcoding shrews.
