N2 - The aim of this paper was to further explore the phylogeny of Siphini by analysing molecular data (two mitochondrial genes and two nuclear markers), together with morphological (29) and ecological (two) characters, for comprehensive analyses concerning the evolution of Siphini, relationships within the tribe, and between Siphini and other Chaitophorinae. Nine Siphini species, which represent all the genera of this tribe, as well as 12 out-group species (mainly Chaitophorini representatives of the genera Chaitophorus and Periphyllus), were used in the analyses. Molecular phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by the Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenetic analysis and maximum parsimony (MP) criterion. The cladistic analysis was performed using nona. The monophyly of Siphini was confirmed. Species belonging to subgenera Sipha and Rungsia were clustered together, and this clade was a sister with reference to a clade including the genera Atheroides and Chaetosiphella. Monophyly of Atheroides was confirmed by the molecular data; however, in cladistic analysis Atheroides seemed to be paraphyletic because Atheroides hirtellus was placed as sister to Atheroides serrulatus and Chaetosiphella. The monotypic genera Caricosipha and Laingia formed separate lineages, and Laingia was sister to all other Siphini. Chaitophorini was not retrieved by the molecular and combined data: Periphyllus was sister to a clade containing Chaitophorus and Siphini.
