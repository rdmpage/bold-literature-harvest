N2 - We have accomplished the nucleotide sequence of the 1537 bp mitochondrial gene coding for small subunit (SSU) rRNA of yeast Hansenula wingei, and also determined the 5'- and 3'-termini by S1 nuclease mapping. Eight universally conserved (U) elements of the SSU rRNA were identified. Comparison of U regions among five fungal mitochondrial SSU rRNA shows the striking similarity between H. wingei and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The construction of the secondary structure revealed a core structure similar to the counterpart of Escherichia coli 16S rRNA. The secondary structure also enabled us the specify seven variable (V) regions differing from those of other mitochondrial SSU rRNAs in size, sequence and possible secondary structure. Molecular phylogenetic evaluation based on U regions of five fungi indicates that mitochondria of H. wingei and S. cerevisiae diverged from the same lineage. This suggests that the evolution of mitochondria-encoded genes does not directly correlate with the alteration of mitochondrial genetic system: genome size, gene organization and codon usage.
