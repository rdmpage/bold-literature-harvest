N2 - DNA barcoding is the process of identification of species
based on nucleotide diversity of short DNA segments.
It is well established in animals with the
introduction of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI)
as a standard barcode. In plants, however, due to the
difficulty in finding a universally acceptable barcode,
it is yet to be well established. Based on the relative
efficacy testing, the Consortium for the Barcode of
Life–Plant Working Group has recently identified a
few loci as potential barcode candidates and from
them a two-locus standard barcode (rbcL + matK) has
been recommended for initiating the barcoding process
of plant species. With 70% species discriminatory
power, this two-locus barcode is capable of serving
many projects, but for better resolution additional loci
need to be used. This article provides an overview of
the technical details, and merits and demerits of these
loci as plant barcodes.
