N2 - This work describes the molecular characterization of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of the mitochondrial DNA from three species of great medical and veterinary importance: the horn fly, Haematobia irritans, the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans and the house fly, Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) (Linnaeus). The nucleotide sequence in all species was 1536 bp in size and coded for a 512 amino acid peptide. The nucleotide bias for an A+T-rich sequence is linked to three features: a high A+T content throughout the entire gene, a high A+T content in the third codon position, and a predominance of A+T-rich codons. An anomalous TCG (serine) start codon was identified. Comparative analysis among members of the Muscidae, Scatophagidae, Calliphoridae and Drosophilidae showed high levels of nucleotide sequence conservation. Analysis of the divergent amino acids and COI protein topologies among these three Muscidae species agreed with the evolutionary model suggested for the insect mitochondrial COI protein. The characterization of the structure and evolution of this gene could be informative for further evolutionary analysis of dipteran species.
