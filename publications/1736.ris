N2 - In this study we analysed mitochondrial DNA variation in Penaeus kerathurus prawns collected from seven locations along a transect across the Siculo-Tunisian region in order to verify if any population structuring exists over a limited geographical scale and to delineate the putative transition zone with sufficient accuracy. Partial DNA sequences of COI and 16S genes were analysed. In contrast to the highly conservative 16S gene, the COI sequences exhibited sufficient diversity for population analysis. The COI gene revealed low levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversities. The size of the annual landings of this commercial species suggests large population sizes. Hence, the low genetic diversity detected in this study could indicate a possible reduction in effective population sizes in the past. We detected significant genetic differentiation between eastern and western populations likely due to restricted gene flow across the Siculo-Tunisian boundary. We discuss the different evolutionary forces that may have shaped the genetic variation and suggest that the genetic divide is probably maintained by present-day dispersal limitation.
