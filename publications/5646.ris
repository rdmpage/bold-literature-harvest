N2 - Morphological examination and a molecular phylogenetic analysis of leeches from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Hawaii show that these specimens are members of a species in the South American Helobdella triserialis species complex. Though it has been seen before, this leech was not recognized as an invasive species. Rather, it was first described as Helobdella striata from Germany later renamed Helobdella europaea and then independently described as Helobdella papillornata from Australia. Because the appropriate name for this leech from its South American endemic locale, Helobdella (triserialis) lineata, is preoccupied by a North American species, we formally recognize H. europaea as the valid taxon name. Although this invader is not a bloodfeeder it may be expected to have an impact on native annelid and mollusk faunas.
