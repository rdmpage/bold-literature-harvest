N2 - Frankliniella Karny is the third most speciose genus within Thysanoptera, with 236 valid species. Despite its high economic relevance and remarkable diversity, the Linnean and Wallacean deficits, as well as the paucity of biological and ecological data are
evident, especially due to the confusing taxonomy of the group. In this sense, we carried out a molecular analysis based on the
Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and an extensive data set towards understanding the molecular delimitation, as well as
establishing genetic diversity thresholds among Frankliniella species. Our study included 348 specimens (20 from the present study)
referring to 43 BINs (Barcode Index Numbers) available in BOLD. For that, the traditional analysis of DNA barcode (NeighborJoining and genetic distances) and the determination of the diversity threshold were carried out, together with two types of phylogenetic analyses (Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference) and five species delimitation algorithms (ABGD, PTP, GMYC,
PhyloMap, BIN). Our analyses identified with high confidence 42 putative species in Frankliniella, suggesting cases of taxonomic
misidentification, and a threshold of 2.35%, which allowed us to recognize a cryptic diversity and/or species complexes in five
species of the genus: F. insularis (Franklin), F. intonsa (Trybom), F. occidentalis (Pergande), F. schultzei (Trybom) and F. tritici
(Fitch). The present data demonstrate the efficiency of molecular markers for the identification of independent evolutionary units
in Frankliniella, reinforcing the need to carry out an extensive taxonomic review in this important group of thrips since different
studies already pointed to incongruity in the diagnosis of species through traditional taxonomy
