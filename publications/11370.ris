N2 - Pakistan is bestowed by a diversified array of wild bird species including collared doves of which the taxonomy has been least studied and reported. DNA barcoding is a geno-taxonomic tool that has been used for characterization of bird species using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI). This study aimed to identify taxonomic order of Pakistani collared dove using DNA barcoding. Purposely herein, we present a phylogenetic analysis of Pakistani collared dove based on 650 base pairs of COI gene sequences. Analysis of phylogenetic tree revealed that Pakistani collared dove shared a common clade with Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) and African collared dove (Streptopelia roseogrisea) which indicated a super-species group in Streptopelia genus. This is the first report of molecular classification of Pakistani collared dove using DNA barcoding.
