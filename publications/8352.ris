N2 - Targeted genomic enrichment followed by next-generation DNA sequencing has dramatically increased efficiency of mutation-discovery efforts. We describe a protocol for genomic enrichment of pooled barcoded samples in a single assay that increases experimental flexibility and efficiency. We screened 770 genes (1.4 megabases) in thirty N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-mutagenized rats and identified known variants at >96% sensitivity as well as new mutations at a false positive rate < 1 in 8 megabases.
