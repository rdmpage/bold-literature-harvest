N2 - Rhinocypha taiwana Wang & Chang, sp. nov. is described and illustrated for both sexes. The genetic distance of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene in R. taiwana and related species ranges from 4.2% to 10.4%. R. taiwana is shown to be a good species based on morphological and genetic criteria. It also is clearly retrieved as a distinct species based on COI phylogenetic analysis. The R. drusilla group is proposed and defined by a combination of characteristics which distinguish them from all other Rhinocypha species: male abdomen with reddish orange markings and S2 with a unique dorsal spade-shaped or similar marking. A key to the males of the six species of the R. drusilla group is provided. Two morphologically distinct continental species, R. drusilla and R. arguta, are shown to have a rather small genetic distance, only 1.2â€“1.7%. More material from the continental populations of this group is needed for further morphological and molecular studies.
