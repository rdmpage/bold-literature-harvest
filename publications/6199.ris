N2 - Because the family Chironomidae, or non-biting
midges, is one of the most species-rich groups of macroinvertebrates
in freshwater habitats, species-level identifications
of chironomids are important for biodiversity
assessments in these ecosystems. Morphology-based species
identifications from adult female chironomids usually
are considerably more difficult than from adult males, or
even impossible; thus, the females are often neglected in
community assessments. We used DNA barcoding to
investigate how inclusion of the females influenced the
species count from springs and spring brooks at Sølendet
Nature Reserve in Central Norway. By means of the
barcodes we were able to identify 77.6% of the females to
species by associating them with males from the study site
or from other regions, whereas the remaining, unassociated
females could be identified to genus level only. The number
of recorded species increased by 27% when females were
included. We also found that DNA barcoding is effective
for the detection of taxonomically challenging species and
species groups. Using DNA barcoding in combination with
traditional taxonomy, we recognised at least five species
new to science and three species and one genus new to
Norway.
