N2 - Platymantis is a group of neobatrachian frogs that occurs from the Philippines to New Guinea ñ an area situated at the interface between the Australian and Asian biogeographical region that is highly fragmented by stretches of open sea. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene are herein used to infer the relationships of species from the Indonesian part of New Guinea (Papua and West Papua Province). The phylogenetic trees reveal a deep bifurcation between the Asian and Western New Guinean clades being consistent with phylogeographic patterns observed in various other faunal groups. While most species are well differentiated in the examined locus, low interspecific genetic distances between one and three percent were observed in the New Guinean species Platymantis papuensis and P.†cryptotis as well as P.†pelewensis from Palau. Platymantis papuensis and P.†pelewensis are geographically separated from each other by a 1100†km stretch of open sea. The minor degree of genetic differentiation between both species points to a recent event of transmarine dispersal as causation for the occurrence of P.†pelewensis on Palau. The low genetic differentiation between P.†cryptotis and the sympatric P.†papuensis, two species that are bioacoustically and morphologically distinct, may indicate its possibly recent evolutionary origin or, alternatively, yet undetected hybridization between the two species. The same may also hold true for frogs from Yapen that exhibit calls different from the sympatric P.†papuensis. Tentatively referred to as Platymantis spec., these frogs are also genetically not well differentiated. It is furthermore concluded that the partly low genetic differentiation of the New Guinean Platymantis species render this group one of the cases in which DNA barcoding would likely fail to produce reliable results.
