N2 - Background: Members of the aquatic monocot family Lemnaceae (commonly called duckweeds) represent the
smallest and fastest growing flowering plants. Their highly reduced morphology and infrequent flowering result in
a dearth of characters for distinguishing between the nearly 38 species that exhibit these tiny, closely-related and
often morphologically similar features within the same family of plants.
Results: We developed a simple and rapid DNA-based molecular identification system for the Lemnaceae based on
sequence polymorphisms. We compared the barcoding potential of the seven plastid-markers proposed by the
CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) plant-working group to discriminate species within the land plants in 97
accessions representing 31 species from the family of Lemnaceae. A Lemnaceae-specific set of PCR and sequencing
primers were designed for four plastid coding genes (rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL and matK) and three noncoding spacers
(atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA) based on the Lemna minor chloroplast genome sequence. We assessed the
ease of amplification and sequencing for these markers, examined the extent of the barcoding gap between intraand
inter-specific variation by pairwise distances, evaluated successful identifications based on direct sequence
comparison of the “best close match” and the construction of a phylogenetic tree.
Conclusions: Based on its reliable amplification, straightforward sequence alignment, and rates of DNA variation
between species and within species, we propose that the atpF-atpH noncoding spacer could serve as a universal
DNA barcoding marker for species-level identification of duckweeds.
