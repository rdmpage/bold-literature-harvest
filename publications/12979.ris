N2 - Background:The detection of eDNA with high-throughput sequencing has rapidly emerged as a method to detect organisms from environmental samples. Environmental DNA (eDNA) studies of aquatic biomes have focused on surveillance of animal species with less emphasis on plants. The pondweeds are one of the most important components of macrophytic plant communities in freshwater ecosystems, providing food and shelter for fishes, birds,macroinvertebrates, and plankton. Identification of pondweeds is especially problematic because aquatic habitats are often less accessible than terrestrial ones. Additionally, microscopic characters make their authentication challenging, particularly for nonspecialists who assist with field work. We used water samples to track pondweed diversity at the Grand River at the Charitable Research Reserve (RARE). Results: We developed an eDNA protocol to detect pondweeds in water samples using specific DNA markers with species-level discriminatory power (atpB-rbcL and ITS2). Short fragments (168–215 base pairs) were successfully amplified using primers targeting genera from the pondweed family (Potamogeton, Stuckenia, and Zannichellia). We identified the presence of seven species at three sites in RARE. In addition to two species previously collected at the site (Stuckenia pectinata and Potamogeton crispus), we detected five species new to the reserve (Stuckenia vaginata, Potamogeton friesii, Potamogeton alpinus, Potamogeton subsibiricus, and Zannichellia palustris). Our data reveal that diversity of pondweeds is possibly higher than predicted by traditional morphological surveys. Significance: Our study uses a targeted approach to track the species composition of pondweeds in freshwater ecosystems. A detected combination of species of pondweeds can work as a “fingerprint”, or indicator for a particular environment, biological community, or water quality. This result suggests that eDNA can be an efficient tool for monitoring plant diversity in aquatic habitats.
