N2 - Background: Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) cause biting nuisance to livestock and humans
and are vectors of a range of pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. Despite their economic significance,
the delineation and identification of species where only morphology is considered, as well as the evolutionary
relationships between species within this genus remains problematic. In recent years molecular barcoding has
assisted substantially in the identification of biting midges in the multiple entomological survey projects which
were initiated in many European countries following the bluetongue outbreak in 2006–2009. These studies revealed
potentially new species and “species-complexes” with large genetic and morphological variability. Here we use
molecular barcoding, together with morphological analysis, to study subgenus Culicoides Latreille from Scandinavia
with focus on three potentially new species.
Methods: Biting midges were collected at various sites in Denmark and Sweden. Culicoides specimens were
described by variation of a fragment of their cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene sequence and wing, palp
and antennal characters.
Results: It is shown that three new species initially separated by DNA barcoding with mitochondrial COI can be
distinguished by morphological characters. In this context a key to Scandinavian subgenus Culicoides using wing
and maxillary palp characters is presented. The key is including the three new species Culicoides boyi, Culicoides
selandicus and Culicoides kalix.
Conclusion: Three new species of Culicoides biting midges were identified and could be identified by both
molecular and morphological differences. Evaluation of differences between and within taxa of biting midges using
COI barcode yielded a rough estimate of species delineation; interspecies differences across Culicoides subgenera
approaches 20%, whereas intraspecies differences are below 4% and in most cases below 1%.
