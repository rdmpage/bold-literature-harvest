N2 - Synopeas maximum Awad & Talamas, sp. nov., the first reported parasitoid associated with the soybean gall midge, Resseliella maxima Gagné, is described based on morphological and molecular data. Parasitoids were reared from soybean stems infested by R. maxima in Minnesota. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the genus Synopeas Förster was performed with COI sequences (n=2412) available on the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD). Phylogenetic and barcode gap analyses suggest 279 Synopeas species in this dataset, with S. maximum sequences forming a monophyletic clade that is distinct from relatives. The Synopeas maximum clade was close to specimens from Canada and the United States, suggesting it is native to North America. We present a taxonomic treatment of S. maximum to facilitate its identification, including comparison to morphologically similar species. This project provides baseline data for further ecological study of R. maxima parasitism, and its management in soybean.
