N2 - A DNA barcoding study was conducted to determine the optimal combination of loci needed for successful species-level
molecular identi&#64257;cation in three extant cycad genera—Ceratozamia, Dioon, and Zamia—that occur in Mexico. Based on conclusions
of a previous multigene study in representative species of all genera in the Cycadales, we tested the DNA barcoding performance of
seven chloroplast coding (matK, rpoB, rpoC1, and rbcL) and non-coding (atpF &#8260;H, psbK &#8260; I, and trnH-psbA) regions, plus sequences
of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer. We analysed data under the assumptions of the ‘‘character attributes organization
system’’ (CAOS), a character-based approach in which species are identi&#64257;ed through the presence of DNA diagnostics. In
Ceratozamia, four chloroplast regions and one nuclear region were needed to achieve > 70% unique species identi&#64257;cation. In
contrast, the two-gene combination atpF &#8260;H + psbK &#8260; I and the four-gene combination atpF &#8260;H + psbK &#8260; I + rpoC1 + ITS2 were
needed to reach 79% and 75% unique species identi&#64257;cation in Dioon and Zamia, respectively. The combinations atpF &#8260;H + psbK &#8260; I
and atpF &#8260;H + psbK &#8260; I + rpoC1 + ITS2 include loci previously considered by the international DNA barcoding community.
However, none of the three combinations of potential DNA barcoding loci found to be optimal with a character-based approach in
the Mexican cycads coincides with the core barcode of chloroplast markers (matK + rbcL) recently proposed for universal use in
the plant kingdom.
