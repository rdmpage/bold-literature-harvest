N2 - Molecular phylogeny of some of the economically important silkmoths was derived using three mitochondrial genes, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and COI, and the control region (CR). Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses showed two distinct clades, one consisting of moths from Bombycidae family and the other from Saturniidae family. The mitochondrial CR showed length polymorphisms with indels. The ML analyses for complete mitochondrial genome sequences of Bombyx mori (strains Aojuku, C108, Backokjam, and Xiafang), Japanese and Chinese strains of B. mandarina (Japanese mandarina and Chinese mandarina) and, Antheraea pernyi revealed two distinct clades, one comprising of B. mori strains and the other with B. mandarina, and A. pernyi forming an outgroup. Pairwise distances revealed that all of the strains of B. mori studied are closer to Chinese than to Japanese mandarina. Phylogenetic analyses based on whole mitochondrial genome sequences, the finding of a tandem triplication of a 126bp repeat element only in Japanese mandarina, and chromosome number variation in B. mandarina suggest that B. mori must have shared its recent common ancestor with Chinese mandarina. Another wild species of the Bombycidae family, Theophila religiosa, whose phylogenetic status was not clear, clustered together with the other bombycid moths in the study. Analysis of the interspecific hybrid, A. proylei gave evidence for paternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA.
