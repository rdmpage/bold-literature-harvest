N2 - Roundworms of the genus Baylisascaris are the most common parasitic nematodes of the intestinal tracts of wild mammals, and most of them have significant impacts in veterinary and public health. Mitochondrial (mt) genomes provide a foundation for studying epidemiology and ecology of these parasites and therefore may be used to assist in the control of Baylisascariasis. Here, we determined the complete sequences of mtDNAs for Baylisascaris schroederi, Baylisascaris ailuri and Baylisascaris transfuga, with 14,778 bp, 14,657 bp and 14,898 bp in size, respectively. Each mtDNA encodes 12 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs, typical for other chromadorean nematodes. The gene arrangements for the three Baylisascaris species are the same as those of the Ascaridata species, but radically different from those of the Spirurida species. Phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated amino acid sequences of 12 protein-coding genes from nine nematode species indicated that the three Baylisascaris species are more closely related to Ascaris suum than to the three Toxocara species (Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati and Toxocara malaysiensis) and Anisakis simplex, and that B. ailuri is more closely related to B. transfuga than to B. schroeder. The determination of the complete mt genome sequences for these three Baylisascaris species (the first members of the genus Baylisascaris ever sequenced) is of importance in refining the phylogenetic relationships within the order Ascaridida, and provides new molecular data for population genetic, systematic, epidemiological and ecological studies of parasitic nematodes of socio-economic importance in wildlife.
