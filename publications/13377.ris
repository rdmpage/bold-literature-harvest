N2 - In the present study we used an integrative taxonomic approach that combines morphological and DNA barcoding data to describe a new species of the H. nigromaculatus-complex, Hygrobates calabricus sp. nov. from Calabria, Italy. The average K2P-distance between DNA-barcode sequences of H. calabricus sp. nov. and its closest relative H. setosus Besseling, 1942 was estimated at 8.7Â±1.2%.
