N2 - Plate tectonics can have profound effects on organismal distribution and is often the driving force in speciation. Through geologic processes, the Baja California Peninsula depicts two faunal patterns: one through southern vicariance with Cape separation, and the other through dispersal onto the northern peninsula, referred to as a 'dual-peninsular effect.' Here we apply a hierarchical sampling strategy that combines population-level sequence data ( approximately 800bp, nad4 region) with complete mt-genome data (aligned 15,549bp) and 5 nuclear protein encoding loci (3315bp), to test whether both patterns have occurred in one group of nightsnakes (Hypsiglena). The geologic formation of the peninsula is thought to have occurred in three stages: (1) Cape separation from mainland Mexico; (2) the northern peninsula separated, forming the northern Gulf of California; and (3) the peninsula was united through volcanic activity, while moving northward causing collision with southern California. However, the timing of events is debated. We explore phylogenetic relationships and estimate dates of divergence for nightsnakes using our hierarchical sampling strategy. Our data support both 'southern-vicariance' and 'northern-dispersal' have occurred in nightsnakes, forming a ring distribution around the Gulf of California. Two divergent forms are sympatric on the southern half of the peninsula with no indication of hybridization. Nightsnakes represent the first group to depict the 'dual-peninsular effect' with extensive overlap on the Baja California Peninsula.
