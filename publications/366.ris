N2 - Ancient Lake Poso on the Indonesian island Sulawesi hosts a highly diverse endemic fauna, including a small species flock of atyid Caridina shrimps, which are characterized by conspicuous colour patterns. We used a mtDNA based molecular phylogeny to test the assumption of a monophyletic origin and intralacustrine radiation of the species flock and to assess the species specificity of some colour morphs. Our data reveal a rapid radiation of Caridina in the entire Poso drainage system, but provide no strong evidence for a monophyletic radiation of the lake species. Nevertheless each lacustrine species shows a varying degree of substrate or trophic specialization, usually considered a hallmark of adaptive radiation. Two distinct colour forms previously attributed to a single species, C. ensifera, lack distinguishing qualitative morphological characters, but are shown to be two different species. In contrast, morphologically rather distinct lake species lacking specific colour patterns may be hybridizing with riverine taxa. These results suggest that colour may play a similar role in species recognition and possibly speciation in ancient lake Caridina as hypothesized, e.g. for some African cichlids.
