N2 - Complete DNA sequences were determined for the mitochondrial (mt) genomes of the needle corals, Seriatopora caliendrum (17,011bp) and S. hystrix (17,060bp). Gene arrangement of the Seriatopora mt genomes is similar to the 14 currently published scleractinian mitogenomes with three unusual features, including an idiosyncratic atp8, a duplicated trnW (tRNA(TRP)), and a putative control region located between atp6 and nad4. Atp8, located between duplicate trnW genes, showed relatively low amino acid similarity (25.6-34.6%) with those of published scleractinian corals. A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the transcription of this novel atp8 gene in Seriatopora. A duplicated trnW was detected in the region close to the cox1 gene and shares the highly conserved primary and secondary structure of its original counterpart. The intergenic spacer between atp6 and nad4, which contains several distinct repeated elements, is being designated as the putative control region in the Seriatopora mt genomes. Evaluation of the molecular evolution of several protein-coding genes and intergenic spacers showed 3- to 4-fold higher divergence rates among populations or between species than those published for scleractinian mt genomes. This study not only successfully revealed the phylogenies of S. hystrix and S. caliendrum from the West Pacific Ocean by mtDNA, but also highlighted the potential utilities of mt hypervariable regions in phylogenetic construction below the species level for Seriatopora.
