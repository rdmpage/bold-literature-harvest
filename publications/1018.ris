N2 - We isolated Rivulus marmoratus mitochondrial DNA by long-polymerase chain reaction with conserved primers, and sequenced it with 36 sets of internal conserved primers, which were designed from the extensive sequence similarities of mitochondrial DNA from several fish species. The R. marmoratus mitochondrial DNA has 17,329 bp with a conserved structural organization compared to those of other fish. Rivulus marmoratus mitochondrial DNA also has two nearly identical control regions. The basic characteristics of the R. marmoratus mitochondrial genome are discussed.
