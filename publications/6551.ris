N2 - • Premise of the study: The Cactaceae are a major New World plant family and popular in horticulture. Still, taxonomic units and
species limits have been diffi cult to defi ne, and molecular phylogenetic studies so far have yielded largely unresolved trees, so
relationships within Cactaceae remain insuffi ciently understood. This study focuses on the predominantly epiphytic tribe Rhipsalideae
and evaluates the utility of a spectrum of plastid genomic regions.
• Methods: We present a phylogenetic study including 52 of the 53 Rhipsalideae species and all the infraspecifi c taxa. Seven
regions ( trnK intron, matK , rbcL , rps3 - rpl16 , rpl16 intron, psbA-trnH , trnQ-rps16 ), ca. 5600 nucleotides (nt) were sequenced
per sample. The regions used were evaluated for their phylogenetic performance and performance in DNA-based species
recognition based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defi ned beforehand.
• Key results: The Rhipsalideae are monophyletic and contain fi ve clades that correspond to the genera Rhipsalis , Lepismium ,
Schlumbergera , Hatiora , and Rhipsalidopsis . The species-level tree was well resolved and supported; the rpl16 and trnK
introns yielded the best phylogenetic signal. Although the psbA-trnH and trnQ-rps16 spacers were the most successful individual
regions for OTU identifi cation, their success rate did not signifi cantly exceed 70%. The highest OTU identifi cation rate
of 97% was found using the combination of psbA-trnH, rps3-rpl16, trnK intron, and trnQ-rps16 as a minimum possible marker
length (ca. 1660 nt).
• Conclusions : The phylogenetic performance of a marker is not determined by the level of sequence variability, and species
discrimination power does not necessarily correlate with phylogenetic utility.
