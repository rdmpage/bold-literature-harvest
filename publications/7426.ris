N2 - A total of 95 nucleotide sequences of a Co1 gene fragment of approximately 650 bp were analyzed
for fishes of the orders Perciformes and Scorpaeniformes (outgroup). Gene trees based on four algorithms
(BA, NJ, MP, and ML) were similar in topology of solved branches. An emphasis was placed on the species
and generic levels, but a significant phylogenetic signal was obtained for higher taxonomic ranks as well. For
instance, a monophyletic origin was confirmed for the family Zoarcidae and the subfamily Opisthocentrinae
(Stichaeidae). The proportion of different nucleotides in the sequences compared (pdistances) significantly
increased with increasing taxonomic rank. The pdistances were estimated for four hierarchic levels and were
(1) 0.15 ± 0.06% for the withinspecies hierarchic level, (2) 6.33 ± 0.37% for the withingenus level, (3) 11.83 ±
0.06% for the withinfamily level, and (4) 15.22 ± 0.05% for the withinorder level. The difference in the
Co1 gene fragments between levels
