N2 - The present article makes an assessment of the molecular sequencing carried out on a large sample of the genus Agrias Doubleday, representative of the widest possible number of populations. the results achieved allowed to add 39 additional data to the 112 already-existing ones in the database BOLDsystems. the confusion that exists in the taxa attached to the data of the base required organization of the sample on the basis ofphenotypical as well as molecular data on the specimens gathered. The clusterization of the data allowed the construction of a distance-based tree for 54 sequences of the gene CO1-5p distributed among 10
operational taxonomic units (OtU). this analysis, together with associated the phenotypical and biogeographical data, resulted in the isolation of 10 species within the genus, which do not exactly correspond to the 10 OtU obtained from the clusterization. Conflicts, which appeared concerning the possible division of the species amydon hewitson into two sibling species and the possible synonymy of the taxa sardanapalus Bates and narcissus Staudinger as a single species, have yet to be resolved and interim solutions are given here. A provisional taxonomic reorganization of the genus has been proposed, in which the taxa lecerfi Michael, sardanapalus Bates, zenodorus hewitson and boliviensis Fruhstorfer have been elevated to species level. pending further information, the taxa amydonius Staudinger, pericles Bates and beatifica hewitson have been temporarily treated as quasi-species within the super-species zenodorus and phalcidon. all in all, a phylogenetic tree including 44 distinct taxa could be established.
The question of the synonymy of the taxa Agrias Doubleday and Prepona Boisduval could not be resolved, but the results allowed confirmation of monophyly of the genus Agrias.
