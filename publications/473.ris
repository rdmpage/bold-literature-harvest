N2 - We present the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the meadow spittlebug Philaenus spumarius (Auchenorrhyncha: Cercopoidae). This contribution represents the second mitochondrial genome from the Hemiptera and the second of the three hemipteran suborders sampled. The genome is a circular molecule of 16 324 bp with a total A+T content of 77.0% and 76.7% for coding regions only. The gene content, order, and structure are consistent with the Drosophila yakuba genome structure (Clary and Wolstenholme 1985) and the hypothesized ancestral arthropod genome arrangement (Crease 1999). Nucleotide composition and codon usage are near the means observed in other insect mitochondria sequenced to date but have a higher A+T richness compared with the other hemipteran example, the kissing bug Triatoma dimidiata (Dotson and Beard. 2001. Insect Mol. Biol. 10: 205-215). The major noncoding region (the A+T rich region or putative control region) between the small ribosomal subunit and the tRNAIle gene includes two extensive repeat regions. The first repeat region includes 19 tandem repeats of a 46-bp sequence, whereas the second contains a longer sequence (146 bp) tandemly repeated four times.
