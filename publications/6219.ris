N2 - Two cruises in the eastern sector of the Southern Ocean (POKER 2006 off the Kerguelen Islands and
CEAMARC 2008 off Terre Adélie and George V Land), with extensive surveys, provided an interesting and abundant liparid fish collection (two genera, 13 species, 90 specimens). The fish were studied with modern approaches in systematic studies, both from morphoanatomy and molecular sequences (COI Barcode). In addition to providing useful descriptions of species often known from few specimens, the geographical distribution and potential bathymetric and local habitats are more precisely described. From molecular results, including for the first time the sequences from specimens of other areas, the tree hints at the non-monophyly of two genera (Liparis and Careproctus) and most clades include species from Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The reference dataset will be useful for further studies on this important family from polar seas.
