N2 - We present the first study examining mtDNA transmission in diatoms, using sexual progeny of the pennate species Haslea ostrearia (Naviculaceae). A fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (cox1) with 7 nucleic substitutions between parental clones was used as a parental tracer in 16 F1 clones obtained from two pairs of mating crosses. Each cross involved a parental clone isolated from France (Bay of Bourgneuf) and Sweden (Kattegat Bay). We determined that all progeny possessed only one cox1 parental haplotype. These results suggest that the mitochondrial DNA transmission in H. ostrearia is uniparental. Implications and new topics of investigation are discussed.
