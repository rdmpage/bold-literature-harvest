N2 - The giant bathymodioline mussels from vents have been studied as models to understand the adaptation of organisms to deep-sea chemosynthetic environments. These mussels are closely related to minute mussels associated to organic remains decaying on the deep-sea floor. Whereas biological data accumulate for the giant mussels, the small mussels remain poorly studied. Despite this lack of data for species living on organic remains it has been hypothesized that during evolution, contrary to their relatives from vents or seeps, they did not acquire highly specialized biological features. We aim at testing this hypothesis by providing new biological data for species associated with organic falls. Within Bathymodiolinae a close phylogenetic relationship was revealed between the Bathymodiolus sensu stricto lineage (i.e. “thermophilus” lineage) which includes exclusively vent and seep species, and a diversified lineage of small mussels, attributed to the genus Idas, that includes mostly species from organic falls. We selected Idas iwaotakii (Habe, 1958) from this latter lineage to analyse population structure and to document biological features. Mitochondrial and nuclear markers reveal a north-south genetic structure at an oceanic scale in the Western Pacific but no structure was revealed at a regional scale or as correlated with the kind of substrate or depth. The morphology of larval shells suggests substantial dispersal abilities. Nutritional features were assessed by examining bacterial diversity coupled by a microscopic analysis of the digestive tract. Molecular data demonstrated the presence of sulphur-oxidizing bacteria resembling those identified in other Bathymodiolinae. In contrast with most Bathymodiolus s.s. species the digestive tract of I. iwaotakii is not reduced. Combining data from literature with the present data shows that most of the important biological features are shared between Bathymodiolus s.s. species and its sister-lineage. However Bathymodiolus s.s. species are ecologically more restricted and also display a lower species richness than Idas species.
