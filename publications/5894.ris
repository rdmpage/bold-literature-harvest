N2 - Despite its distinctive morphology, the taxonomy of the Australian Painted Snipe has been unsettled, with some authors treating it as a full species, Rostratula australis (Gould 1838), and others treating it as a subspecies of the Greater Painted Snipe, Rostratula benghalensis. We sequenced the DNA of five mitochondrial genes (Cyt b, ND5, ATP 6â€“8, COIII and COI) of Australian Painted Snipe, Greater Painted Snipe and South American Painted Snipe, Nycticryphes semicollaris. The sequences of Australian Painted Snipe were 10% different from those of Greater Painted Snipe from Africa and South-east Asia, which differed from one another by only 2%. Plumage and anatomical characters can also distinguish the Australian and the Greater Painted Snipes. Our results clearly indicate that the Australian Painted Snipe is a distinct species that diverged ~19 million years ago (mya) (95% credible interval 13.0, 27.4 mya).
