N2 - Large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) sequence data from 120 taxa and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1(COI) sequence data from 27 taxa are analyzed separately and together to estimate the internal phylogeny of the class Demospongiae and to evaluate how consistent these data are with pre-existing hypotheses of relationship concerning order-level monophyly and relationships. The monophyly of Porifera is only slightly inconsistent with LSU data, which do not support the monophyly of the class Demospongiae regardless of the inclusion or exclusion of Homoscleromopha (this result is likely due to the placement of a single hexactinellid taxon within the Demospongiae), however, no LSU support is found for the monophyly of Silicea (Demospongiae+Hexactinellida) unless homoscleromorphs are excluded. Neither the subclasses Ceractinomorpha and Tetractinomorpha, nor the orders Halichondrida, Hadromerida, and Haplosclerida are supported as monophyletic under any data partition. The haplosclerid suborders Haplosclerina and Petrosina are supported as monophyletic to the exclusion of the suborder Spongillina, and the orders Dictyoceratida, Verongida, Poecilosclerida, Astrophorida, Spirophorida, Homosclerophorida, and Agelasida are largely reconstructed as monophyletic, with the exception of few anomalously placed taxa. Few inter-order relationships are strongly supported by any data partition, but there is moderate support for a verongid+chondrosid clade and a tetractinellid+halichondrid clade. Furthermore, LSU data strongly support the existence of two novel clades that do not correspond to the existing classification and that show no morphological uniformity. Finally, every data partition supports the monophyly of a clade that includes the order Agelasida, some members of the genus Axinella, and two taxa tentatively identified as belonging to the orders Hadromerida and Halichondrida.
