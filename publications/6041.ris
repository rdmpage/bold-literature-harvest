N2 - The complete mitochondrial genomes of the parasitic trematodes Opisthorchis felineus and Clonorchis sinensis (family Opisthorchiidae) were fully sequenced in order to develop markers for DNA diagnostics of the liver flukes infection, molecular ecology, population and phylogenetic studies. The complete sequences of mitochondrial genomes of these species comprise 14,277 and 13,875bp, respectively, and are thus the shortest trematode mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date. The gene content and arrangement are identical to that of Fasciola hepatica. ATG and GTG are used as the start-codons and TAG and TAA are used as the stop-codons. The stop-codon TAG of the C. sinensis nad1 gene overlap by 1nt with the downstream tRNA-Asn gene. Alternative structures for the Ser(UCN) tRNAs were found for both species. The noncoding control regions are separated into two parts by the tRNA-Gly gene and contain neither tandem repeats, which are characteristic for trematode control regions, nor secondary structures. In conclusion, the complete mitochondrial DNA sequences of O. felineus and C. sinensis will serve as a resource for comparative mitochondrial genomics and systematic studies of parasitic trematodes.
