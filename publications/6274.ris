N2 - The objectives of this study were barcoding and taxonomic analysis of the five tilapiine species (Oreochromis aureus, O. niloticus, O. mossam- bicus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, and Tilapia zillii), two tilapia hybrid strains (Florida red tilapia and Philippine red tilapia), and two endemic wild cichlids (Tristramella simonis and Astatotilapia flaviijosephi) available in Israel, as well as O. urolepis hornorum. Cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) 619 bp sequence traces of 104 individuals were assembled, aligned, and compared (GenBank project GI 209553463). The DNA sequences of two hybrid strains were identical to those of O. hornorum and O. aureus. Absence of intra-specific variability was detected in the commercially used species, O. aureus, S. galilaeus, O. mossambicus, and O. urolepis horno- rum. Two DNA sequence variants were detected in O. niloticus originating from Ghana and Egypt. In contrast, 2-3 variants were detected in the DNA of each of the non-commercial species. Amino-acid sequences were identical in all “true tilapias” and different from the sequences in the endemic cichlids. As a whole, the protein phylogenetic tree fitted the expected conventional taxonomy as opposed to the respective DNA-based tree. Sequences FJ348047-FJ348150 were submitted to GenBank via the BOLD database (identical to FISH001-08 - FISH104-08 in this database).
