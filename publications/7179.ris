N2 - The scyphozoan genus Aurelia has been recorded as occurring circumglobally
between 70°N to 55°S. However, it has not been reported from the Pacific coast of
South America. Here, we describe the occurrence of Aurelia in the fjords of Chile
and use morphology and a simple “DNA barcoding” sequence similarity comparison
to identify the species as most probably A. aurita. This species likely is not
indigenous to this region.
