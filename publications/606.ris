N2 - The first complete mitochondrial genome of a representative of the Symphyla, Scutigerella causeyae (Arthropoda: Myriapoda), was sequenced using a PCR-based approach. Its gene order shows different positions for three tRNA genes compared to the ancestral arthropod pattern. Presence of a pseudogene with partial sequence similarity to rrnS favours the duplication-random loss model as an explanation for at least one of the translocations. None of the genome rearrangements hypothesized for S. causeyae are shared by any of the other four myriapod mitochondrial genomes sequenced so far (two from Chilopoda and two from Diplopoda). Different rearrangement events must have occurred independently in the lineages leading to S. causeyae, Lithobius forficatus, Scutigera coleoptrata and Diplopoda. Phylogenetic analyses could not unequivocally elucidate the position of Symphyla among myriapods. While the nucleotide dataset of eleven protein-coding genes gives weak support for an affinity to Chilopoda, this is not recovered with the corresponding amino acid dataset.
