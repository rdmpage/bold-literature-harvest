N2 - DNA barcodes is a short sequence of intrinsic DNA that can be easily generated and characterized for all species on the planet. In this way, DNA barcoding is usually used for large surveys aiming at unknown species detection and identification of species with medical, ecological and agronomical significance. Here, we intentionally incorporated a synthesized DNA barcode in the genome of lactic acid bacteria for marking bio-information. The DNA barcode was comprised of sequences having specific PCR primers, alphabetical information sequence of bacterial strain, chloramphenicol-resistant gene (CAT) and mosaic end sites (ME) for recognition of transposase. The bacterial information sequence was made by reverse-coding alphabetical words into base sequences using gene-code table. The names of microbial strain, owner, inventers and number of patent depository were encoded in the base sequence. The constructed DNA barcode (117 bp) was randomly integrated into chromosomal DNA of Leuconostoc citreum using a viral transposase after electroporation. The chloramphenicol-resistant mutants were isolated and successful integration of barcode sequence was confirmed by PCR amplification using designed primers. DNA sequence analysis of amplified barcode and translation of codes into alphabetical abbreviation of amino acids reproduced the bio-information originally marked in the genome of L. citreum. This barcoding method can be used to recognize, detect and trace dispersal of patented organisms in biotechnology, either to certify the source organism or secure intellectual property rights for bioresources.
