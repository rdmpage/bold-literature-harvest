N2 - Species of the marine mussel genus Mytilus are known to contain two mitochondrial genomes, one transmitted maternally (the F genome) and the other paternally (the M genome). The two genomes have diverged by more than 20% in DNA sequence. Here we present the complete sequence of a third genome, genome C, which we found in the sperm of a Mytilus galloprovincialis male. The coding part of the new genome resembles in sequence the F genome, from which it differs by about 2% on average, but differs from the M genome by as much as the F from the M. Its major control region (CR) is more than three times larger than that of the F or the M genome and consists of repeated sequence domains of the CR of the M genome flanked by domains of the CR of the F genome. We present a sequence of events that reconstruct most parsimoniously the derivation of the C genome from the F and M genomes. The sequence consists of a duplication of CR elements of the M genome and subsequent insertion of these tandemly repeated elements in the F genome by recombination. The fact that the C genome was found as the only mitochondrial genome in the sperm of the male from which it was extracted suggests that it is transmitted paternally.
