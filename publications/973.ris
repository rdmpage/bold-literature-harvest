N2 - The complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial DNA of the rainbow trout, Onchorynchus mykiss, has been determined. The total length of the molecule is 16,660 bp. The rainbow trout mitochondrial DNA has the same organization described in eutherian mammals, the clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), and the two fish species, Oriental stream loach (Crossotoma lacustre) and carp (Cyprinus carpio). Alignment and comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the 13 proteins encoded by rainbow trout and other vertebrate mitochondrial genomes allowed us to estimate that COI is the most conserved mitochondrial subunit (amino acid identity ranging from 85.6% to 94.8%) whereas ATPase 8 is the most variable one (amino acid identity ranging from 30.8% to 70.4%). Putative secondary structures for the 22 tRNAs found in the molecule are given along with an extensive comparison of tRNA sequences among representative species of each major group of vertebrates. In this sense, an unusual cloverleaf structure for the tRNASer(AGY) is proposed. A stem-loop structure inferred for the origin of the L-strand replication (OL) and the presence of a large polycytidine tract in the OL loop is described. The existence of this stretch instead of the usual T-rich sequence reported so far in mammal mtDNAs is explained in terms of a less-strict template dependence of the RNA primase involved in the initiation of L-strand replication.
