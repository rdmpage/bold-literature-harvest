N2 - We report complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes for a penguin (little blue, Eudyptula minor) and a goose (greater white-fronted, Anser albifrons). A revised annotation of avian and reptile mt genomes has been carried out, which improves consistency of labeling gene start and stop positions. In conjunction with this, a summary of mt gene features is presented and a number of conserved patterns and interesting differences identified. The protein-coding genes from the two new genomes were analysed together with those from 17 other birds plus outgroup (reptile) taxa. The unrooted amino acid tree from 19 avian genomes was locally stable with many high bootstrap values using several maximum likelihood methods. In particular, Anseriformes (goose and duck) grouped strongly with Galliformes (chicken) to form Gallianseres, while the penguin paired firmly with the stork. The position where the outgroup joined the avian tree varied with the combination of outgroup taxa used. The three best supported positions of the root were passerine, but the traditional rooting position between paleognaths and neognaths could not be excluded.
