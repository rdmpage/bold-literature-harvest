N2 - DNA extraction from minute hymenopterans and their larvae is difficult and challenging because of their small size indicating
a low amount of starting material. Hence, 11 DNA extraction methods were compared to determine their efficacy in
isolating DNA. Success of each method was scored on a 2% agarose gel after PCR of the cox 1 mitochondrial locus. A silicamembrane-
based approach was the most successful, followed by a method using a combination of incubation buffers and
amethod using magnetic beads. Themethod using buffers was the most cost- and time effective. Using this method, larvae
from Eucalyptus seed capsule galls could be assigned a role (parasitoid, gall former or inquiline) in the gall-inhabiting
complex.
