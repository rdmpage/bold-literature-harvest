N2 - The Coleoptera order is the richest group among Metazoa, but its phylogenetics remains incompletely understood. Among Coleoptera, bioluminescence is found within the Elateroidea, but the evolution of this character remains a mystery. Mitochondrial DNA has been used extensively to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, however, the evolution of a single gene does not always correspond to the species evolutionary history and the molecular marker choice is a key step in this type of analysis. To create a solid basis to better understand the evolutionary history of Coleoptera and its bioluminescence, we sequenced and comparatively analyzed the mitochondrial genome of the Brazilian luminescent click beetle Pyrophorus divergens (Coleoptera: Elateridae).
