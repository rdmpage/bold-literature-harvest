N2 - Background: Climate change and the globalization of commerce are contributing to the spread of alien invasive species across both terrestrial and aquatic biomes with sometimes devastating consequences for native species. Their spread also poses significant socio-economic challenges for humanity. The Global Invasive Alien Species Partnership was developed to help identify and track invasive species in an effort to aid their management. Molecular methods like DNA barcoding provide a means of facilitating the rapid and accurate identification of invasive species for all users, but the extent of their coverage in barcode reference libraries is unknown. Here we perform a gap analysis of global invasive alien species against the Barcode of Life Data System. Results: Barcode libraries are only partially complete for many quarantine pests, vectors of zoonotic diseases, and other socioeconomically relevant taxa. There is at least some sequence data available to aid the identification of nearly all listed invasive alien species. However, the number of barcode records for each species varies considerably, as does the quality of the meta data associated with those records. Significance: DNA barcoding is poised to support identification efforts of invasive alien species and to facilitate biomonitoring programs using environmental or eDNA given a relatively modest investment in validating and expanding the barcode libraries currently available.
