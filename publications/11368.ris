N2 - A set of homologous primers were designed to provide the amplification of microsatellite markers in a variety of salmonid species. They can help to solve problems associated with the genetics and conservation biology of salmonids, viz., (1) species identification; (2) determination of interspecific hybrids; (3) genetic estimation of salmonid biodiversity in a watershed; (4) individualization of tissue samples, i.e., testing on their belonging to the same individual; and (5) identification of a fishâ€™s origins.
