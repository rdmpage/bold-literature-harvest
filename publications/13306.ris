N2 - Technological and analytical advances to study evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are realized through molecular approaches including DNA barcoding. We characterized the usefulness of COI DNA barcodes in green turtles in Mexico to better understand genetic divergence and other genetic parameters of this species. We analyzed 63 sequences, 25 from green turtle field specimens collected from the Gulf of Mexico and from the Mexican Pacific, and 38 already present in the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD). A total of 13 haplotypes were identified with 4 novel haplotypes from the Pacific Ocean and 3 novel haplotypes from the Atlantic Ocean. Intraspecific distance values among COI gene sequences by two different models were 0.01, demonstrating that there is not a subdivision for green turtle species. Otherwise, the interspecific distance interval ranged from 0.07 to 0.13 supporting a clear subdivision among all sea turtle species. Haplotype and total nucleotide diversity values of the COI gene reflect a medium genetic diversity average. Green turtles of the Mexican Pacific showed common haplotypes to some Australian and Chinese turtles, but different from the haplotypes of the Mexican Atlantic. COI analysis revealed new haplotypes and confirmed that DNA barcodes were useful for evaluation of the population diversity of green turtles in Mexico.
