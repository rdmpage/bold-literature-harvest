N2 - Concerning the nomenclature, most problems arise from the great confusion due to the morphological similarities in Pampus. Twenty-five individuals in Pampus were sampled from different localities about 2,000Â km apart along the coast of China covering the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and the South China Sea. The sequences of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and 16S rRNA (16S) genes of the mitogenomes were determined. Combined with the morphological characteristics, five Pampus species, P. minor, P. punctatissimus, P. chinensis, P. cinereus and Pampus sp., were identified. The genetic distance of intraspecies ranged from 0.000 to 0.004, while it varied from 0.012 to 0.133 for interspecies based on the 16S sequences. For COI sequence data analysis, the genetic distance of intraspecies ranged from 0.000 to 0.005, while it varied from 0.057 to 0.162 for interspecies. Phylogenetic trees showed that all Pampus fishes reciprocally constituted a monophyletic group with strong support. The sister-group relationships between P. minor and Pampus sp. and between P. chinensis and P. punctatissimus were revealed respectively. In the current GenBank data, P. minor is considered P. cinereus or P. argenteus by mistake. For the lack of a P. echinogaster specimen, we cannot decide on the name of Pampus sp. as P. argenteus or P. echinogaster.
