N2 - BACKGROUND:
The DNA barcoding system using the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene (cox1 or COI) is highly efficient for discriminating vertebrate and invertebrate species. In the present study, we examined the suitability of cox1 as a marker for Trypanosoma cruzi identification from other closely related species. Additionally, we combined the sequences of cox1 and the nuclear gene glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) to evaluate the occurrence of mitochondrial introgression and the presence of hybrid genotypes.

METHODS:
Sixty-two isolates of Trypanosoma spp. obtained from five of the six Brazilian biomes (Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado and Pantanal) were sequenced for cox1 and GPI gene fragments. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. Molecular species delimitation was evaluated through pairwise intraspecific and interspecific distances, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery, single-rate Poisson Tree Processes and multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes.

RESULTS:
Both cox1 and GPI genes recognized and differentiated T. cruzi, Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma dionisii and Trypanosoma rangeli. Cox1 discriminated Tcbat, TcI, TcII, TcIII and TcIV. Additionally, TcV and TcVI were identified as a single group. Cox1 also demonstrated diversity in the discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI, TcII and TcIII and in T. c. marinkellei and T. rangeli. Cox1 and GPI demonstrated TcI and TcII as the most genetically distant branches, and the position of the other T. cruzi DTUs differed according to the molecular marker. The tree reconstructed with concatenated cox1 and GPI sequences confirmed the separation of the subgenus Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) sp. and the T. cruzi DTUs TcI, TcII, TcIII and TcIV. The evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was informative for DTU differentiation using both genes. In the cox1 analysis, one SNP differentiated heterozygous hybrids from TcIV sequences. In the GPI analysis one SNP discriminated Tcbat from TcI, while another SNP distinguished TcI from TcIII.

CONCLUSIONS:
DNA barcoding using the cox1 gene is a reliable tool to distinguish T. cruzi from T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii and T. rangeli and identify the main T. cruzi genotypes.
