N2 - The nucleotide sequence of the African side-necked turtle mitochondrial control region and its flanking tRNA genes was determined. This 73% A+T-rich region is 1194 bp long. Several conserved motifs involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial genome replication process, including one conserved sequence block (CSB1), and three termination-associated sequences were identified. The most remarkable feature found in this control region was the presence of six microsatellite-containing tandem repeats between the CSB1 motif and the tRNAPhe gene. The potential usefulness of this microsatellite sequence for population-level studies is enhanced by its unique localization in the maternally inherited mitochondrial molecule.
