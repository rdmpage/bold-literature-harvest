N2 - Six species of sugarcane armyworms (Mythimna spp.) are known to occur in Mauritius, namely M. pseudoloreyi, M. loreyi, M. insulicola, M. phaea, M. tincta and M. pyrausta. Due to the close resemblance of the adult moths, morphological distinction among the different species is difficult and may lead to misidentification. One new approach for their characterisation involves the use of DNA barcodes to analyse the sequence diversity within a short standardised segment of their genome. Polymorphism in the 5â€™ end of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene is extensively used as a DNA barcoding system in Lepidopterans. In 2008, adult moths of M. insulicola, M. phaea and M. pseudoloreyi were reared from field-collected larvae. Two nucleic acid extraction methods were evaluated, both yielding high quality DNA for molecular studies. DNA extractions were performed from different body parts including abdomen, leg and wing. A ~700 bp PCR fragment amplified from the three species, using primers HCO2198/LCO1490, was digested using restriction enzymes. A combination of four enzymes Rsa1, TaqI, PvuII and SacI successfully allowed distinction of the three species of armyworms tested. The PCR products from the three species were cloned and sequenced. A 658 bp fragment from each of M. insulicola, M. phaea and M. pseudoloreyi was submitted to Genbank and respectively recorded as Leucania insulicola, GQ353294; Leucania phaea, GQ353295; and Leucania loreyi, GQ353296. Using the Barcode of Life identification engine (BOLD-ID), high sequence identities were obtained with Leucania species (Noctuidae: Hadeninae) 99.54% for L. phaea and Leucania sp. (from Kenya), 100% for L. loreyi and Leucania sp. and 99.85% for L. insulicola and L. striata (from Madagascar). The L. phaea sequence diverged by 7.3% and 10.6% from those of L. loreyi and L. insulicola respectively. A sequence divergence value of 8.5% was observed between L. loreyi and L. insulicola. DNA barcoding and sequencing could provide useful information for classification and characterisation of armyworms.
