N2 - The complete DNA sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Onchocerca volvulus is described. The O. volvulus mitochondrial genome is 13747 bp, slightly smaller than the mitochondrial genomes of the nematodes Ascaris suum and Caenorhabditis elegans, and the smallest metazoan mitochondrial DNA molecule reported to date. The O. volvulus mitochondrial genome contains genes for two ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs and 12 proteins. Consistent with the small size of the genome, four gene pairs overlap and eight contain no intergenic regions. Only 17 intergenic regions are found, ranging in size from 1 to 46 bp. As in C. elegans and A. suum, the O. volvulus mitochondrial genome lacks an open reading frame encoding ATPase subunit 8, and all genes are apparently transcribed in the same direction. However, the mitochondrial gene order of O. volvulus differs from that of A. suum, C. elegans and other metazoan mitochondrial genomes. A total of 20 of the 22 transfer RNAs encoded in the O. volvulus mitochondrial genome have the potential to fold into secondary structures lacking the TpsiC arm, as has been reported in other nematodes. The genome exhibits a striking codon bias, with 15/20 amino acids having a single codon preference of > 70%.
