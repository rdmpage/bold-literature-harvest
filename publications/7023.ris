N2 - We describe ten new species of treefrogs assigned to the genus Boophis (Anura: Mantellidae) and resurrect two species
from synonymy, based on materials collected during fieldwork in Madagascar, carried out mainly between 2000 and
2007. Our comparative database assembled over the past years comprises fresh material for molecular analysis from all
58 nominal Boophis species, and advertisement call recordings from all except three species. We follow an integrative
approach and combine molecular, bioacoustic and morphological evidence to diagnose the new species. In most cases,
the new species have uncorrected molecular divergences of over 4–5% in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene to their closest
relatives. In some cases the divergences are lower (2–2.5%) but are then accompanied by distinct differences in
advertisement calls or morphology. Boophis piperatus sp. nov. from Ranomafana National Park is a small brown species
assigned to the B. majori group that is similar to B. miniatus but differs in morphology and advertisement calls. Boophis
arcanus sp. nov. is assigned to the B. majori group as well and is known from only two female specimens from a site
close to Ranomafana; it is described mainly based on its strong genetic differentiation (> 7.2% to all other species). Boophis
entingae sp. nov. is a species of the Boophis goudoti group occurring in northern Madagascar, similar to and sympatric
with B. brachychir, but with a strongly different advertisement call. Boophis roseipalmatus sp. nov. belongs to the
B. goudoti group, is similar to B. madagascariensis, and appears to replace this species in most of northern Madagascar,
with possible areas of sympatry in the north east.
