N2 - • Premise of the study: Primers were designed for amplifying intron 1 of the single-copy nuclear LEAFY gene for species of Davalliaceae. 

• Methods and Results: New primer sets were designed and successfully amplified for intron 1 of the LEAFY gene in 13 species representing the five genera of Davalliaceae. The orthology of these sequences was further confirmed by phylogenetic analyses. Site variation in LEAFY intron 1 sequences across genera of the Davalliaceae and among accessions of the Humata repens complex were 18% and 8%, respectively. Such variation was greater than that for the cpDNA atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer region across the same taxa and accessions. 

• Conclusions: Using our newly designed primers, intron 1 of the LEAFY gene could be amplified for all species tested. In addition, this single-copy, biparentally inherited, and quickly evolving region showed considerable potential for addressing infraspecific-level questions.
