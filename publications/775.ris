N2 - The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the blackspot seabream, Pagellus bogaraveo, was obtained using the long PCR/cloning method. The total length of the mitogenome was 16,941 bp, and had a gene content (13 protein-coding, two ribosomal RNAs, and 22 transfer RNAs) and organization similar to those observed in most other vertebrates. Nevertheless, two main features in the WANCY region revealed as unique in P. bogaraveo mitogenome. First, the O(L) was disrupted by the insertion of a 66 bp long element that was determined to be a tRNA(Cys) pseudogene; second, the existence of high levels of length heteroplasmy, both intra-and inter-individuals, as a result of sequence duplications and deletions. The tandem duplication and random loss (TDRL) model as well as recombination are proposed to account for the length heteroplasmy and gene rearrangements in the P. bogaraveo WANCY region.
