N2 - We considered the contribution of two mitochondrial and two nuclear data sets for the phylogenetic reconstruction of 22 species of seed beetles in the genus Curculio (Coleoptera: Cuculionidae). A phylogenetic tree from representatives found on various hosts was inferred from a combined data set of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I, mitochondrial cytochrome b, nuclear elongation factor 1alpha, and nuclear phosphoglycerate mutase, used for the first time as a molecular marker. Separate parsimony analyses of each data set showed that individual gene trees were mainly congruent and often complementary in the support of clades but the analysis was complicated by failure of PCR amplification of nuclear genes for many taxa and hence missing data entries. When the four gene partitions were combined in a simultaneous analysis despite the missing data, this increased the resolution and taxonomic coverage compared to the individual source trees. Alternative approaches of combining the information via supertree methodology produced a comparatively less resolved tree, and hence seem inferior to combining data matrices even in cases where numerous taxa are missing. The molecular data suggest a classification of the European species into two species groups that are in accordance with morphological characteristics but the data do no support any of the previously recognised American species groups.
