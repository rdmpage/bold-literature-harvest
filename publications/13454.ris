N2 - Colletotrichum species are among the most devastating plant pathogens in a wide range
of hosts. Their accurate identification requires a polyphasic approach, including geographical, ecological,
morphological, and genetic data. Solanaceous crops are of significant economic importance
for Bulgarian agriculture. Colletotrichum-associated diseases pose a serious threat to the yield and
quality of production but are still largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to identify and
characterize 26 pathogenic Colletotrichum isolates that threaten solanaceous crops based on morphological,
pathogenic, and molecular data. DNA barcodes enabled the discrimination of three main
taxonomic groups: C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. coccodes. Three different species of acutatum
complex (C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. salicis) and C. cigarro of the gloeosporioides complex were
associated with fruit anthracnose in peppers and tomatoes. The C. coccodes group was divided in two
clades: C. nigrum, isolated predominantly from fruits, and C. coccodes, isolated mainly from roots.
Only C. salicis and C. cigarro produced sexual morphs. The species C. godetiae, C. salicis, and C. cigarro
have not previously been reported in Bulgaria. Our results enrich the knowledge of the biodiversity
and specific features of Colletotrichum species, which are pathogenic to solanaceous hosts, and may
serve as a scientific platform for efficient disease control and resistance breeding.
