N2 - Background: The Muscidae (house-flies and relatives) is an ecologically diverse family of Diptera found in a wide range of terrestrial and freshwater habitats. In Canada, the group is especially well represented in alpine and northern environments where they often account for more than 25% of all Diptera species. Muscids have recently been the focus of various ecological and monitoring studies in alpine, northern, and agricultural habitats; however, the large number of species and the difficulties associated with morphology-based identification (especially of females) remain important challenges. Previous work has demonstrated a high correspondence between morphology and DNA barcodes for muscid flies. Using the largest data set available to date, the present study aims at populating a complete reference library of DNA barcodes (COI) for the Canadian muscid fauna, which is thought to include 500 species. Results: Our data set includes 22 386 sequences representing 438 operational taxonomic units under the Barcoding Index Number (BIN) system, half of which are already determined to species. Based on morphological examination of representative specimens, we have now completed a generic assignment for all BINs. Preliminary results on species-level identification generally indicate strong correspondence between BINs and morphology, with occasional cases of over-splitting or over-lumping. We also report rare cases where morphologically distinct taxa shared identical barcodes. Significance: Our DNA barcode reference library for the Muscidae of Canada will be relevant to the fields of agriculture, conservation, and vector biology by (i) improving our ability to properly assess the status of both invasive and native members of the Canadian insect fauna; and (ii) facilitating future investigations into the community ecology, biodiversity, and monitoring of insect assemblages, especially in northern Canada.
