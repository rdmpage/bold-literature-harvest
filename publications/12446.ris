N2 - Current literature indicates the presence of the archaic moth family Micropterigidae on New Caledonia but gives little indication of its diversity and significance. By 1985, three species of the genus Sabatinca had been described for the island. In 2010, a further two species in two new genera were added. Recent fieldwork has revealed species richness greater than that of the northern and central European fauna of Micropterix (the genus with most described species in this family). Their diversity and evolution on an emergent SW Pacific island whose age and previous land connections are hotly debated, provides a fascinating challenge in historical biogeography
with the potential to illuminate the age and history of inundation of the island and its past geological setting. On-going taxonomic research reveals at least 55 species in three genera on the island, with relationships to both Australia and New Zealand. COI DNA barcoding indicates that the New Caledonian fauna represents two of the five major lineages in the family —the Australian lineage, poorly represented with two described species; and the Sabatinca lineage whose type species is New Zealandian, with a highly diverse
New Caledonian radiation (~33 taxa analysed so far). These new molecular data lead to a reassessment of the phylogenetics of the genus Sabatinca and the previous use of the term ‘sabatincoid’. The main taxonomic outcome is to present a subdivision of Sabatinca into three informal species groups: 1) an incongruella group, which includes two New Zealand species and all those known from New Caledonia; 2) a chrysargyra group, and 3) a calliarcha group, the last two confined to New Zealand. We provide diagnostic morphological and molecular characters for the three monophyletic groups recognised within the Sabatinca lineage. COI indicates that the New Caledonianlineage has been derived from an earlier diversification of the Sabatinca species group in New Zealand. Our Beast dating analysis, constrained by non-sabatincan micropterigid and trichopteran fossil calibrations, implies that radiations of the clearly monophyletic genus Sabatinca started at around 84 Ma, with the New Caledonian radiation at ca. 52 Ma and New Zealand chrysargyra group at
ca. 50 Ma. Both dates are long before the widely accepted ages of the modern islands following their respective ‘drowning events’. The radiation of both the Sabatinca lineage and the New Zealand/New Caledonia components of the Australian group lineage are largely compatible with a vicariant trans-Tasman history.
