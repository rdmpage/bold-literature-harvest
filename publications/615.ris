N2 - The complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of the neuropathogenic bird schistosome Trichobilharzia regenti was fully sequenced in order to develop molecular markers for future diagnostic, molecular ecological, population, and phylogenetic studies. The genome was 14,838 bp in length, with a 68.4% AT bias in protein coding regions. A repeat element (3 x 184 bp) between trnV and trnW distinguished a single short noncoding region. As 9 of 14 genera of schistosomes parasitize birds, future characterization of their mt genomes is desirable for species-specific and strain- or population-specific diagnostic markers; this concerns not only the nasal representatives, e.g., T. regenti characterized in this study, but also numerous species within the predominant group of visceral (blood dwelling) bird schistosomes.
