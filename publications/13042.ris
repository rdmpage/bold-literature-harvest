N2 - High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have opened new avenues for the study of biodiversity. This innovation has resulted in an exponentially increasing number of concepts, methods, and research studies in the fields of metabarcoding and metagenomics (MBMG). Furthermore, studies applying novel MBMG approaches are often accompanied by large data files. While research programs are being transformed by HTS, scientific journals are unable to catch up with the fast pace of developments in this field. The publication of papers in nonmachine-readable format (e.g., paper/PDF) hampers research progress by creating obstacles to the interoperability and re-use of scientific data. In response to the increased interest in molecular biodiversity, ecology, and evolution, as well as in DNA-based monitoring, Pensoft will apply its extensive experience as a technological innovator and open access advocate to launch a conceptually and technologically innovative open science journal, Metabarcoding and Metagenomics (MBMG). Featuring novel article formats and data publishing workflows, MBMG will reflect the rapid growthin the useof metabarcoding and metagenomics in the life and environmental sciences. The journal will cover diverse topics including environmental, microbial, and applied MBMG (e.g., biomonitoring, quarantine, environmental assessment, nature conservation, eDNA, species invasions), and associated topics such as molecular ecology, DNA-based species delimitation and identification, and other emerging fields related to MBMG. Sub-missions of bioinformatic approaches to MBMG (algorithms, software) are also encouraged. MBMG is published on the high-tech ARPHA journal publishing platform, which is the first workflow to support the full life cycle of a manuscript, from writing through submission, peer review, publication, and dissemination within a single online collaborative platform. The XML-based workflow used by the journal ensures that content and data are available for extraction, indexing, and re-use immediately following publication.
