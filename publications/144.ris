N2 - Mitochondrial genes for cytochrome oxidase I (COI) from hydrothermal-vent-endemic gastropods of the genus Alviniconcha were sequenced to determine the phylogenetic relationships among specimens from three areas in the western Pacific. Individuals of Alviniconcha hessleri were collected at two vent fields (depths 1470 m and 3600 m) in the Mariana Trough. Specimens collected in the North Fiji Basin could be divided into two genetically distinct groups, both of which also differed from A. hessleri from the Mariana Trough. None of the specimens of the genus Alviniconcha collected in the Manus Basin differed genetically from the dominant group from the North Fiji Basin. We suggest that the specimens of the genus Alviniconcha analyzed in the present study can be tentatively classified into A. hessleri and two undescribed species.
