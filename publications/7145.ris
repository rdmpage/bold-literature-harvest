N2 - The genus Boophis is a species-rich group of treefrogs within the family Mantellidae Laurent, endemic to Madagascar.
The larval morphology of these frogs is an important trait to understand the evolution of reproductive modes and larval
morphologies in the mantellid radiation and can provide important information to compare adaptations of tadpoles and
adults, and elucidate possible covariation, and convergent evolution of these traits. We here assign seven previously
unknown or insufficiently described Boophis tadpoles to species via DNA barcoding, and provide detailed
morphological descriptions based mainly on the unambiguously identified DNA voucher specimens. All described
tadpoles are stream-adapted, exotrophic tadpoles of a relatively generalized morphology. Applying our previous
classification for stream-breeding Boophis based on relative oral disk width and the number of papillae and keratodonts
we attempt an assignment of all species into ecomorphological guilds. Our results show that this previous definition of
guilds (in Boophis) based on only three characters was an oversimplification, and that the variation in these tadpoles is
more complex. In a phylogenetic context we found that species within at least two species groups of Boophis are
heterogeneous in their assignment to the ecomorphological guilds confirming the probable non-monophyly of these
groups.
