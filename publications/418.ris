N2 - Using partial DNA sequence data from nuclear 28S and 18S genes and mitochondrial 16S and COI genes, we reconstructed a phylogeny of the family Eurytomidae. Both maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods were employed. The analysis revealed a significant incongruence between the mitochondrial genes and the nuclear genes, and we chose the results from the nuclear genes as our preferred hypothesis. Our phylogeny suggested that the family Eurytomidae is not a monophyletic group; neither are the genera Eurytoma and Bruchophagus. The monophyly of genera Sycophila and Plutarchia was well supported, as was the close association of the genera Aiolomorphus, Tenuipetiolus, Bephratelloides, and Phylloxeroxenus. Our phylogeny also revealed an anticipated pattern, in which species groups from the genera Eurytoma and Bruchophagus are often more closely related to other small genera than to other species groups of the same genus. Subsequent taxonomic revisions include elevating the subfamily Rileyinae to a family status and the divisions of the genera Eurytoma and Bruchophagus.
