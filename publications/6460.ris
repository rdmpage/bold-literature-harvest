N2 - Systematic uncertainties in the crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes are well grounded by the number of species and subspecies described using different approaches, causing scientists to define this taxon as "complex". However, a key task that conservation programmes are facing regarding the recent and drastic decline of European populations, is the coherent systematic classification of this threatened species. Here we present results obtained by coupling mtDNA and genome analysis suggestive of a novel evolutionary framework to explain the relationships among phylogenetic lineages of A. pallipes. The direct sequencing of mtDNA COI gene fragment revealed a strong geographic structure with four distinct haplogroups separated by a range of 5-25 mutations. However, mitochondrial data were not supported by genomic fingerprinting based on 535 AFLP polymorphisms. Nuclear markers showed an unexpected moderate level of genetic differentiation and the absence of any geographic structure. Consequently, this study proposes that the taxonomic hypothesis of a single species of A. pallipes settling the Italian continental waters, is affected by complex evolutionary events. To solve the paradox, we hypothesized an evolutive scenario in which the separation of ancient mtDNA lineages likely occurred before the latest glacial periods. However, the speciation process remained incomplete due to secondary intensive postglacial contacts that forced the mingling of the genomes, and confounds the phylogeographic signature still detectable within mtDNA. Postglacial dispersion and the following demographic events, such as founder effects, drift and bottlenecks, abruptly depleted the local mtDNA variation, and shaped the current genetic population structure of white-clawed crayfish.
