N2 - Bean thrips, Caliothrips fasciatus, is native to western North America. Once considered a pest of several crops in its native area, its pest status has waned over recent decades. However, due to its habit of aggregating in the navel of navel oranges, bean thrips remains economically important because some countries importing oranges from California have designated it a quarantine pest. Despite continued propagule pressure, bean thrips has never established outside North America. We examined genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA among Californian populations of C. fasciatus and found that potentially two cryptic species are present (supported by Kimura 2-P distances): a common widespread form B and a rarer form A with a very limited distribution. Form B showed strong phylogeographic structure, with many haplotypes having a limited geographic distribution. Inter-population crossing experiments between three geographically isolated populations of form B resulted in the production of some female offspring, indicating a degree of compatibility between these populations of this haplodiploid species. However, substantial outbreeding depression was also detected. A low frequency of offspring production by hetero-population pairs was evidence of pre-mating isolation, while post-mating isolation was also evident in the elevated mortality of fertilized eggs in successful hetero-population crosses. One surprising finding was the total lack of offspring production by virgin females when isolated individually. However, virgin females did produce sons in the presence of other virgin females. A test for the presence of Wolbachia showed that form B was not infected, but that some populations of the rarer form A were.
