N2 - Previous studies reported Cryptococcus laurentii strains to secrete mycocins of different inhibition range. These mycocinogenic strains were studied by molecular methods to verify their phylogenetic relationships. Based on the combined analysis of LSU and ITS sequence data, these strains were confirmed to belong to the species C. laurentii. Therefore, different strains of the same basidiomycetous yeast C. laurentii secrete a distinct mycocin. This trait has not been demonstrated for basidiomycetous yeasts before. Additionally, this study provides several DNA-barcodes (LSU, ITS and RPB1) and reports their variability for this species.
