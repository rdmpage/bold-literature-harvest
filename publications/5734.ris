N2 - The 655 bp cytochrome c oxidase subunit I barcode region of single specimens of 388 species of fishes (four Holocephali, 61 Elasmobranchii and 323 Actinopterygii) was examined. All but two (Urolophus cruciatus and Urolophus sufflavus) showed different cox1 nucleotide sequences (99.5% species discrimination); the two that could not be resolved are suspected to hybridize. Most of the power of cox1 nucleotide sequence analysis for species identification comes from the degenerate nature of the genetic code and the highly variable nature of the third codon position of amino acids. Variation at the third codon position is bimodally distributed, and the more variable mode is dominated by amino acids with four or six codons, while the less variable mode is dominated by amino acids with two codons. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synomymous changes is much less than one, indicating that this gene is subject to strong purifying selection. Consequently, cox1 amino acid sequence diversity is much less than nucleotide sequence diversity and has very poor species resolution power. Fourteen of the 16 amino acid residues recognized as having important functions in the region of cox1 sequenced were completely conserved over all 388 species (and the bovine cox1 sequence), with one fish species varying at one of these sites, and three fish at another site. No significant differences in amino acid conservation were observed between residues in helices, strands and turns. Patterns of nucleotide and amino acid variability were very similar between elasmobranchs and actinopterygians.
