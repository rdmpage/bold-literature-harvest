N2 - We examined the population genetics of six species of marine cladocerans, using a ~600Â bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene sequence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant intraspecific, semi-allopatric phylogenetic breaks in four out of five species belonging to the Podonidae, supporting an ancient radiation and oceanic expansion for this group. By contrast, Peniliaavirostris (Sididae) displayed no phylogeographic structure across a global sampling, suggesting a recent worldwide expansion. Our results also show a transoceanic distribution of identical or very similar haplotypes in several species of marine Cladocera, which may be interpreted as either natural transport or evidence of recent anthropogenic transport. If the latter is the case, marine cladocerans represent one of the first genetically documented cases of exotic or invasive marine zooplankton, likely an underreported group.
