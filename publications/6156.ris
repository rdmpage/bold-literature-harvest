N2 - Family Catostomidae is a diverse group of benthic freshwater fishes that are distributed across North America and in parts of East Asia. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of Catostomidae is examined using 3436 nucleotides of mitochondrial ND4 and ND5 protein coding genes and intervening tRNAs. All 13 genera and 60 species of catostomids were sampled to represent diversity of the family. Catostomidae and its four subfamilies were found to be monophyletic; however, relationships of the subfamilies are not strongly supported with bootstrapping. The analysis provides strong support for recognizing four tribes in subfamily Catostominae.
