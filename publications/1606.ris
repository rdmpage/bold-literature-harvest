N2 - Using long-polymerase chain reaction (Long-PCR) method, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Phthonandria atrilineata. The complete mtDNA from P. atrilineata was 15,499 base pairs in length and contained 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a control region. The P. atrilineata genes were in the same order and orientation as the completely sequenced mitogenomes of other lepidopteran species. The nucleotide composition of P. atrilineata mitogenome was biased toward A + T nucleotides (81.02%), and the 13 PCGs show different A + T contents that range from 73.25% (cox1) to 92.12% (atp8). Phthonandria had the canonical set of 22 tRNA genes, that fold in the typical cloverleaf structure described for metazoan mt tRNAs, with the unique exception of trnS(AGN). The phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed with the concatenated sequences of the 13 PCGs of the mitochondrial genome, which confirmed that P. atrilineata is most closely related to the superfamily Bombycoidea.
