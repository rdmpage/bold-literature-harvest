N2 - In this study, the complete nucleotide sequence (17,962 bp) of the mitochondrial DNA of Amolops tormotus was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The gene content, base composition and codon usage of A. tormotus conformed to those of typical vertebrate patterns. Among 22 tRNAs, the novel position of the tRNA-His gene was in the D-loop region, which was a novel mtDNA gene rearrangement in amphibians. Phylogenetic analyses were based on a 885-bp sequence of 12S and 16S rRNA for species of Amolops and other related species, concatenated sequences of the 11 protein-encoding genes of 13 species.
