N2 - A 1.3-kb mitochondrial DNA segment from the Japanese scallop Patinopecten yessoensis was cloned and sequenced. This segment contained the transfer RNA(Met) gene and partial sequences of 2 ribosomal RNA genes, together with 2 separate noncoding regions (designated NcR1 and NcR2). The NcR regions derived from 78 individuals cultured in Lake Saroma or Matsu Bay, were sequenced, and we found 15 loci with sequence alterations including 13 substitutions, 1 deletion, and 1 insertion (1 locus in NcR1, 14 loci in NcR2), and 17 haplotypes. Of the 17 haplotypes, 10 were found in the Saroma population only, 3 in the Mutsu population only, and 4 in both populations. The gene diversity and nucleotide diversity values were, respectively, 0.87 and 0.0069 for the Saroma population, 0.63 and 0.0040 for the Mutsu population, and 0.83 and 0.0203 overall. Thus the NcR segment was considered to have sufficient sequence variation for population genetic studies. The 16 variants of the NcR2 sequence were separated successfully by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, confirming the sequence variation in NcR2.
