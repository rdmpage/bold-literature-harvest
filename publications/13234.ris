N2 - Tomares hairstreaks comprise about 10 species distributed from Europe and North Africa to Central Asia. The taxonomy of the genus is hampered by the absence of diagnostic characters by which specimens can be unambiguously assigned to species. Our investi- gation of morphology and DNA barcode variations within and between Tomares species shows that while well-defined species (T. ballus, T. mauritanicus, T. callimachus, T. desinens and T. fedtschenkoi) diverge, poorly characterized taxa (T. nogelii, T. nesimachus, T. dobrogensis, T. romanovi and T. telemachus) show very little to no differentiation in mtDNA. We reinstate Tomares callimachus spp. hafis (Kollar, 1849) as a valid subspecies (stat. rev.) and propose taxa telemachus Zhdanko, 2000 and uighurica Koçak, Seven & Kemal, 2000 as synonyms of T. romanovi and T. nogelii nogelii respectively (syn. nov.). We relegate Polyommatus epiphania Boisduval, 1848, recently revived as a valid subspecies of T. callimachus, back to synonymy under the latter, and reconsider the status of T. nogelii dobrogensis (Caradja, 1895) in the light of new molecular data. We use a nuclear gene (EF-1α) in addition to COI barcodes to reconstruct the phylogeny of the group.
