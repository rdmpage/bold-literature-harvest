N2 - Background: High rates of loss and species discovery have lead to the urgent need for more rapid assessments of species diversity and distribution in the herpetofauna, an approach now offered through DNA barcoding. Prior DNA barcoding work on reptiles and amphibians has revealed higher biodiversity counts than previously estimated due to cases of cryptic and undiscovered species in both classes. Despite past research, these taxa are very much in need of comprehensive specieslevel coverage. Results: This study constructs a reference library of DNA barcodes for North American reptiles and amphibians and assesses their applicability as a technique for species delimitation. This study also examines the correspondence of current species boundaries with the BIN system. Barcodes were obtained from 732 specimens, representing 282 species (44%) of the North American herpetofauna. Mean intraspecific divergences were 1% and 3%, while average congeneric sequence divergences were 16% and 14% in amphibians and reptiles, respectively. BIN assignments corresponded perfectly with current species boundaries in 58% of these species. Barcode sharing was observed in four genera of reptiles, while deep divergences (>2%) were noted in 21% of the species. Using multiple primers and a refined PCR regime, barcode fragments were recovered from 5 of 208 formalinfixed specimens, demonstrating that formalin collections can expand genetic databases. Significance: This is the first effort to compile a reference library of DNA barcodes that provides specieslevel identifications for reptiles and amphibians across a broad geographic area. DNA barcodes from North American herpetofauna were used to quickly and effectively flag errors in museum collections, and cases of BIN splits and merges successfully identified taxa belonging to deeply diverged or hybridizing lineages. This study also highlights the merit of further investigation into obtaining genetic material from formalin-fixed tissue and the use of DNA barcodes for biodiversity forensics.
