N2 - This study describes Bucculatrix flavimaculata sp. nov., a new species of Bucculatrix from the Ogasawara Islands in Japan, feeding on Hibiscus. Photographs of adult male and female genitalia and their larval biology (e.g., host plants and feeding habits) are shown. We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI-5P) DNA barcode sequences, including those of some Japanese Bucculatrix species related to B. flavimaculata sp. nov. In addition, we discuss the relationships within the species group.
