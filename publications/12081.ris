N2 - Representatives of the genus Praomys occur throughout the African intertropical zone. It is unclear how many species this genus contains, nor do we know the exact distribution ranges and phylogenetic relationships of these taxa. Using molecular (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and morphological (multivariate craniometry) analyses we clarify the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships among the Praomys occurring in Africa's lowland tropical rainforests. We studied most species known from this area, based on specimens collected in seven countries (Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Gabon, Congo Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo). In our study, Praomys appears to be monophyletic. Our results identify two species complexes: the jacksoni complex includes at least two species (P. jacksoni and P. mutoni) and the tullbergi complex contains at least four species (P. tullbergi, P. rostratus, P. misonnei, P. petteri). Although the 16S rRNA gene appears insufficient to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among all the members of the tullbergi species complex, it is suitable for the identification of most of the studied species, and its use has allowed us to redefine the geographical limits of several species. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 145, 539–553.
