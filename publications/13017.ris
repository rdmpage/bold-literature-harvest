N2 - Background: Islands possess varied histories and geographical and ecological settings, and they are exposed to different stochastic events. Because of this complexity, the mechanisms determining and maintaining species assemblages on islands are poorly understood, and analyses of entire taxonomic groups of sufficiently large areas are necessary to disentangle the array of factors that determine the composition and genetic attributes of island communities. We use comparative analyses linking community and phylogenetic approaches for the butterfly fauna of the circum-Sicilian islands, a key intercontinental region in the western Mediterranean, to understand the factors that shaped the observed assemblages and to highlight populations of exceptional conservation value. Results: Species richness was mainly influenced by contemporary factors, but Pleistocene connections also had a significant impact. A nested pattern was detected when all species were considered, but this pattern disappeared when they were divided into “widespread” and “uncommon” taxa. The frequency of a species on the mainland was a weak predictor of its frequency on islands, and most residuals appeared related to migratory or sedentary behavior. DNA barcoding of more than 80% of the butterfly species recorded in the region revealed that Europe and north Africa formed two well-differentiated genetic groups and that islands showed a high similarity with the mainland they were formerly connected to during Pleistocene low sea levels. Genetically diversified lineages were most frequent in “uncommon” species, while “widespread” species were genetically homogeneous. Significance: This study used an unprecedented integrative approach to examine the biogeography of an entire superfamily in a complex biogeographical contact zone. For the first time, it was possible to recognize the processes responsible for the observed species assemblages and to highlight the uniqueness of each island community. These patterns also revealed the value of assessing morphospecies coupled with information on intraspecific genetic diversity to obtain the information needed for accurate conservation decisions.
