N2 - Ecologists and conservation biologists are increasingly focusing on quantifying the phylogenetic component of biodiversity in order to inform basic and applied research. A major obstacle of this approach in tropical ecosystems has been the difficulty of generating high-quality phylogenetic trees for the vast numbers of species in these systems. Phylogenetic trees inferred from DNA barcodes hold the potential to overcome this obstacle. Here, I present a methodological framework for analyzing the phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity of ecological communities using a phylogenetic tree. The analytical approach is presented using the freely available and widely used software platform “R”.
