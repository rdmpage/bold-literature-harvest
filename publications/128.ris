N2 - We determined the nucleotide sequences of a part of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene (1,000 bp) for twelve species of Asian phytophagous ladybird beetles belonging to the genus Epilachna, and constructed molecular phylogenetic trees for ten "Henosepilachna" species, using two "Epilachna" species as outgroups. Based on the suggested phylogenetic trees, we discussed taxonomic issues and the direction of host shift in these epilachnines.
