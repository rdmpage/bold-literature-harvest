N2 - Philodendron (Araceae) is one of the largest Neotropical plant genera, with approximately 500 species and at
least 1000 species predicted. There is a considerable ecological diversity in the group, although most species
occur in the humid forests of tropical America. Despite being relatively well-studied in taxonomic analyses, the
relationships among the traditional morphological groups of the genus are not well-established, mainly regarding
the three traditional subgenera, referred here as Philodendron sensu lato (s.l.), P. subg. Pteromischum, P.
subg. Philodendron and P. subg. Meconostigma, which was recently recognized as a separate genus,
Thaumatophyllum. Therefore, the present work evaluates the phylogenetic position and the monophyly of
Philodendron s.l. and its three main subdivisions, and the sister groups within the Homalomena clade, which also
includes the Neotropical genus Adelonema, the two Asian genera Homalomena and Furtadoa, and the two African
genera Cercestis and Culcasia, by means of molecular phylogenetic approaches including chloroplast DNA (atpFatpH,
rpl32-trnL, trnQ-5′-rps16 and trnV-ndhC) and nuclear (ITS2) markers. The monophyly of Philodendron s.l.
and its three lineages is confirmed and our analyses corroborate previous morphologic data indicating
Thaumatophyllum as sister to the clade formed by P. subg. Pteromischum and P. subg. Philodendron.
