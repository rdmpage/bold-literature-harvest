N2 - We determined the whole mitochondrial genome sequence for spotted green pufferfish, Tetraodon nigroviridis (Teleostei: Tetraodontiformes). The genome (16,488 bp) contained 37 genes (two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and 13 protein-coding genes) plus control region as found in other vertebrates, with the gene order identical to that of typical vertebrates. The sequence was used to estimate phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among major lineages of fishes, including representative model organisms in fishes. We employed partitioned Bayesian approaches for these two analyses using two datasets that comprised concatenated amino acid sequences from 12 protein-coding genes (excluding the ND6 gene) and concatenated nucleotide sequences from the 12 protein-coding genes (without 3rd codon positions), 22 transfer RNA genes, and two ribosomal RNA genes. The resultant trees from the two datasets were well resolved and largely congruent with those from previous studies, with spotted green pufferfish being placed in a reasonable phylogenetic position. The approximate divergence times between spotted green pufferfish and model organisms in fishes were 85 million years ago (MYA) vs. torafugu, 183 MYA vs. three-spined stickleback, 191 MYA vs. medaka, and 324 MYA vs. zebrafish, all of which were about twice as old as the divergence times estimated by their earliest occurrences in fossil records.
