N2 - We investigate the species discriminatory power of a subset of the proposed plant barcoding
loci (matK, rbcL, rpoC1, rpoB, trnH-psbA) in Carex, a cosmopolitan genus that represents one
of the three largest plant genera on earth (c. 2000 species). To assess the ability of barcoding
loci to resolve Carex species, we focused our sampling on three of the taxonomically bestknown
groups in the genus, sections Deweyanae (6/8 species sampled), Griseae (18/21 species
sampled), and Phyllostachyae (10/10 species sampled). Each group represents one of three
major phylogenetic lineages previously identified in Carex and its tribe Cariceae, thus permitting
us to evaluate the potential of DNA barcodes to broadly identify species across the tribe and
to differentiate closely related sister species. Unlike some previous studies that have suggested
that plant barcoding could achieve species identification rates around 90%, our results suggest
that no single locus or multilocus barcode examined will resolve much greater than 60%
of Carex species. In fact, no multilocus combination can significantly increase the resolution
and statistical support (i.e., ³ 70% bootstrap) for species than matK alone, even combinations
involving the second most variable region, trnH-psbA. Results suggest that a matK barcode
could help with species discovery as 47% of Carex taxa recently named or resolved within
cryptic complexes in the past 25 years also formed unique species clusters in UPGMA trees.
Comparisons between the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and matK in
sect. Phyllostachyae suggest that matK not only discriminates more species (50–60% vs.
25%), but it provides more resolved phylogenies than ITS. Given the low levels of species
resolution in rpoC1 and rpoB (0–13%), and difficulties with polymerase chain reaction amplification
and DNA sequencing in rbcL and trnH-psbA (alignment included), we strongly advocate that
matK should be part of a universal plant barcoding system. Although identification rates in
this study are low, they can be significantly improved by a regional approach to barcoding.
