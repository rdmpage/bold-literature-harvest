N2 - Seven species of Black Fungus Gnats were identified morphologically and by DNA barcoding from insects that were collected on pine branches in urban green spaces in Mashhad (Iran). Bradysia cellarum Frey, Bradysia ocellaris (Comstock), Bradysia trivittata (Staeger), Lycoriella sativae (Johannsen) and Scatopsciara atomaria (Zetterstedt) were found to be new to Iran. Bradysia cellarum Frey spec. rev. is again recognized as a distinct species.
