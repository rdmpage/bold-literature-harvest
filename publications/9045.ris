N2 - The Philodromus pulchellus species-group is defined and diagnosed. Eleven species are included, described or redescribed, keyed and illustrated: P. afroglaucinus, sp. nov. from Algeria; P. bistigma Simon, 1870, P. glaucinus Simon, 1870, P. lamellipalpis, sp. nov. from Algeria; P. medius O. P.-Cambridge, 1872; P. pardalis, sp. nov. from northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula; P. pulchellus Lucas, 1846, P. punctigerus O. P.-Cambridge, 1908, P. ruficapillus Simon, 1885, P. simoni de Mello-Leitão, 1929, and P. wunderlichi, sp. nov. from the western Canary Islands. The validity of P. bistigma and P. medius is re-established (formerly in synonymy with P. pulchellus); neotype and lectotype, respectively are newly designated. The following new synonymies are proposed: P. torquatus O. P.- Cambridge, 1908 = P. pulchellus; P. salinarum Denis, 1939 = P. glaucinus; P. glaucinoides Wunderlich, 1987 = P. punctigerus; P. marionschmidti (Schmidt, 1990) = P. pulchellus. Philodromus albopictus Simon, 1875 and P. rubidus Simon, 1870 are considered nomina dubia. Determination of phylogenetic relationships within the group is difficult owing to continuous character variation, resulting in partially incongruent reconstructions using morphological and molecular data (partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene). Dispersal vicariance analysis provides support for a western Mediterranean origin of the group.
