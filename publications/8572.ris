N2 - In order to investigate the genetic diversity of two newly discovered chicken breeds (Jinhu silky and Wahui) and their genetic relationships with other indigenous chicken breed (Langshan), the COI gene of these three breeds were analyzed by amplification and direct sequencing. The results showed that the selectived sequence of COI had ten SNPs and seven haplotypes, three of SNPs were specific mutation sites, five of haplotypes were specific haplotypes. The Pi of Jinhu silky, Wahui and Langshan were 0.068, 0.051 and 0.369%, respectively and the Hd were 0.4167, 0.3030 and 0.9000, respectively. The Kimura 2-parameter distances between breeds ranged from -0.002 to 0.236. The genetic distances of intrapopulation were less than that of interpopulation. The data suggest that the genetic diversity of Langshan was higher than that of two newly discovered breeds, the specific mutation sites and haplotypes provide the gist for variety identification.
