N2 - New records of water mites collected in 2022 and 2023 from northeastern Iran and southwestern Turkiye, are presented. DNA barcodes of 58 specimens, morphologically assigned to 13 species were newly generated. An integrative approach that combines morphology and DNA barcodes revealed three new species for water mite fauna of TÃ¼rkiye, i.e. Lebertia variolata Gerecke, 2009, Torrenticola baueri Bader & Sepasgozarian, 1987 and Atractides zagrosensis Pesic, Saboori & Asadi, 2016, significantly widening their so far known area of distribution. Torrenticola ramini Bader, 1988, is reported for the first time since its original description, and T. eseni sp. nov. is described as new to science.
