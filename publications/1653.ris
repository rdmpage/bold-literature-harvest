N2 - Mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence is unusually high between several species of the Pissodes strobi complex, in contrast to low allozyme and morphological divergences, and the ability to hybridize in the laboratory. We sequenced an 810 bp segment in seven individuals, representing four species in the P. strobi complex and one outgroup species, P. affinis Randall. The 810 bp segment covered the 3' half of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. We also sequenced one specimen of P. strobi (Peck) over a 2301 bp region of mtDNA, extending from the 5' end of COI to the 3' end of COII. Uncorrected sequence divergences were below 1.1% among three specimens of P. schwarzi Hopkins, and between P. terminalis Hopping and P. nemorensis Germar. All other interspecific combinations in the P. strobi complex showed divergences of 6.0-7.5%. The outgroup species, P. affinis, had an average divergence of 12.8% from members of the P. strobi group. As in most other insects, A + T content in Pissodes mtDNA was high; transition:transversion ratio was high among lineages exhibiting low divergences, but declined with increasing sequence divergence; and inferred amino acid sequence divergences were low. The degree of sequence divergence differs markedly across different functional regions of the COI gene. The high mtDNA divergences within the P. strobi complex calculated from direct sequencing support earlier reports based on restriction site surveys; however, cladograms based on mtDNA sequence differ from those based on earlier work.
