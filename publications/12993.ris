N2 - Background: The Bio-Inventory and Collections Unit (BIC) of the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario (BIO) has committed substantial resources to the collection of specimens from across Canada and the globe. This effort has paid off, as exemplified by the over 95 000 BINs on the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) that stem solely from BIC's collecting efforts. The BIC's natural history collection contains over 2 million voucher specimens; 80% have an associated cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode greater than 500 bp, and 20% have images. Exciting opportunities for collaboration with other institutions are being pursued, first by the publication of large datasets on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and second by our expanding outgoing loan program. Results: As part of BIC's commitment to open-access specimen data, it has contributed 320 000 specimen records to GBIF via Canadensys, which accounts for one-third of arthropod records on the Canadensys repository. Since 2012, BIC has loaned nearly 20 000 specimens to taxonomists around the world. Some of these loans were initiated by BIC to obtain identifications of unknown material, and other loans were initiated by taxonomists interested in viewing recently collected specimens from their area of interest. Case studies illustrate the ways in which BIC's collection has contributed to work by taxonomists and biodiversity scientists. Significance: BIC's ability to collect mass arthropod samples each field season combined with high-throughput specimen processing and DNA barcoding has created a constantly improving and evolving natural history collection. The pairing of our specimens with DNA barcode sequences means we are not constrained by the availability of taxonomists to sort and identify incoming material. With increased online visibility of the natural history collection, BIC is expanding its role as a valuable resource for researchers worldwide.
