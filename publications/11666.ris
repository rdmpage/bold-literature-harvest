N2 - Two new and phylogenetically closely related species in Aspergillus section Fumigati are described and illustrated. Homothallic Aspergillus waksmanii sp. nov. was isolated from New Jersey soil (USA) and is represented by the ex-type isolate NRRL 179T ( = CCF 4266T = Thom 4138.HS2T = IBT 31900T). Aspergillus marvanovae sp. nov. was isolated from water with high boracic acid anions content in Dukovany nuclear power station (Czech Republic). The sexual stage of this species is unknown, but the MAT1-1 locus was successfully amplified suggesting that the species is probably heterothallic and teleomorphic but is represented by only the ex-type isolate CCM 8003T ( = CCF 4037T = NRRL 62486T = IBT 31279T = IFM 60873T). Both species can be distinguished from all previously described species in section Fumigati based on morphology, maximum growth temperature, sequence data from five unlinked loci and unique secondary metabolites profiles.     The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the ITS, β-tubulin, calmodulin, RNA polymerase II and actin gene sequences of the ex-type strains of Aspergillus waksmanii sp. nov. and Aspergillus marvanovae sp. nov. are EF669934, EF669794, EF669863, EF669722, HE974405 and HE974450, HE974387, HE974389, HE974396, HE974401, respectively.
