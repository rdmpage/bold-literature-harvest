N2 - Background: The rise of invasive aquatic plants in South Africaâ€™s waterways is a significant environmental threat to the already fragile indigenous aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide. With the spotlight on aquarium and ornamental pond industries as the primary pathways by which non-native freshwater plants are introduced to South Africa, regulations such as the NEM:BA Act 10 of 2004 together with some national programs are currently in place to ensure compliance by the different role players. Despite these national initiatives, progress has been hampered by additional challenges, especially pertaining to species identification. As a result, we use a DNA barcoding approach as a tool to provide rapid and accurate identification of alien aquatic species currently in trade with the aim of providing a solution to border control officials to monitor plants coming into the country through various ports of entry. Results: We present results of the first DNA barcode reference library of traded aquatic flora. For 142 aquatic plants from nine aquariums around Johannesburg, 90% could be identified to species level. Surprisingly, of all the traded species, 19% were categorized as 1a (Invasive Species), 8% as 1b (Invasive Species Controlled by Programme), and another 15% as prohibited under the NEM:BA Act. Additionally, more than 40% of these species originate from Asia, with a marginal 7% originating from other African countries. Significance: The results presented here have serious implications for the current nationwide invasive species management programmes. For implementation, a mixed technology solution has been developed in collaboration with the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, Canada, and the Department of Environmental Affairs, South Africa (the LifeScanner Application), empowering the general community to identify suspect material.
