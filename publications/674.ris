N2 - The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene was partially sequenced for 164 Ancylostoma caninum individuals, originating from five different localities in Brazil, with the aim of describing the genetic diversity and genetic structure of Brazilian hookworm populations. Allelic and nucleotide diversity were moderate (overall h=0.88 and pi=0.016) and were similar among cities. There was moderate genetic differentiation among the populations sampled (approximately Phi(ST)=0.12) and a weak but nonsignificant correlation between geographical and genetic distance. This genetic structure was similar to that observed among populations of the human hookworm, Necator americanus, but distinct from that typically found in trichostrongylid nematode parasites of livestock. Thus, a pattern of different genetic structures among different groups of nematodes is emerging. We also observed a few individuals that had a highly divergent mtDNA sequence (almost 7% sequence divergence from the other sequences). These results in combination with data from other studies suggest that A. caninum populations worldwide consist of a mix of previously differentiated populations, or perhaps even cryptic species. This study contributes to the knowledge of genetic structure and diversity of hookworms, which in turn will be useful in developing methods for their control.
