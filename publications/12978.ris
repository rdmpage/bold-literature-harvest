N2 - Background:While all shelled mollusks can produce pearls, not all of them are valued as gems. Saltwater pearls produced by oysters of the family Pteriidae are among the most valuable and oldest gems. Most freshwater pearls are from mollusks within the order Unionoida (families Unionidae and Margaritiferidae). The majority of freshwatercultured pearls are produced by species of the genus Hyriopsis (or their hybrids) that are commonly farmed in Asia. North America has a diverse molluscan fauna (300 species) capable of producing natural pearls. Some natural pearl-producing US freshwater mollusks are rare and endangered due to pollution and disturbed habitats, and thus natural pearls often have higher value compared to cultured ones. Pearls cultured in domesticated freshwater mussels and saltwater oysters represent a billion-dollar industry that is in need of a technique to verify the species and origin of the pearls. Results: We generated a small reference library of DNA barcodes for pearl-bearing freshwater mollusks consisting of 15 records from the tissues and shells of the species Amblema plicata, Fusconaia ebena, Lasmigona holstonia, Plectomerus dombeyanus, and Megalonaias nervosa. Pearls of various sources were either micro-drilled or crushed using liquid nitrogen and mortar and pestle.We combined previously published DNA extraction protocols for pearls with newly designed primers for PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to recover 100-bp fragments from 5 out of the 14 pearls. Four of the pearls were identified as M. nervosa and one to the genus Potamilus. Significance: This study provided assignment of individual pearls to oyster species associated with the pearl industry. The substantial difference in value between natural and cultured freshwater pearls makes our work of high interest to the jewelry industry. Since some pearls are bleached to improve their appearance, then further investigation needs to be carried out to determine whether bleached pearls retain detectable DNA
