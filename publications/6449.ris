N2 - Mitochondrial genome sequence and structure analysis has become a powerful tool for studying molecular evolution and phylogenetic relationships. To understand the systematic status of Trichiurus japonicus in suborder Scombroidei, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence using the long-polymerase chain reaction (long-PCR) and shotgun sequencing method. The entire mitogenome is 16,796bp in length and has three unusual features, including (1) the absence of tRNA(Pro) gene, (2) the possibly nonfunctional light-strand replication origin (O(L)) showing a shorter loop in secondary structure and no conserved motif (5'-GCCGG-3'), (3) two sets of the tandem repeats at the 5' and 3' ends of the control region. The three features seem common for Trichiurus mitogenomes, as we have confirmed them in other three T. japonicus individuals and in T. nanhaiensis. Phylogenetic analysis does not support the monophyly of Trichiuridae, which is against the morphological result. T. japonicus is most closely related to those species of family Scombridae; they in turn have a sister relationship with Perciformes members including suborders Acanthuroidei, Caproidei, Notothenioidei, Zoarcoidei, Trachinoidei, and some species of Labroidei, based on the current dataset of complete mitogenome. T. japonicus together with T. brevis, T. lepturus and Aphanopus carbo form a clade distinct from Lepidopus caudatus in terms of the complete Cyt b sequences. T. japonicus mitogenome, as the first discovered complete mitogenome of Trichiuridae, should provide important information on both genomics and phylogenetics of Trichiuridae.
