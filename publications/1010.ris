N2 - The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the screwworm Cochliomyia hominivorax was determined. This genome is 16,022 bp in size and corresponds to a typical Brachycera mtDNA. A Serine start codon for COI and incomplete termination codons for COII, NADH 5 and NADH 4 genes were described. The nucleotide composition of C. hominivorax mtDNA is 77% AT-rich, reflected in the predominance of AT-rich codons in protein-coding genes. Non-optimal codon usage was commonly observed in C. hominivorax mitochondrial genes. Phylogenetic analysis distributed the Acalypterate species as a monophyletic group and assembled the C. hominivorax (Calyptratae) and the Acalyptratae in a typical Brachycera cluster. The identification of diagnostic restriction sites on the sequenced mitochondrial genome and the correlation with previous RFLP analysis are discussed.
