N2 - Carpocoris mediterraneus    Tamanini, 1958, synonymized with  Carpocoris fuscispinus  (Boheman, 1851) by Ribes  et al.  (2007), is restored to the species level. The shape of the pronotum is a good diagnostic character to distinguish the two species. The existence of two valid species is supported by geographical distribution patterns in Western Europe: Medi-terranean-Atlantic for  C. mediterraneus , and Continental for  C. fuscispinus . In France and Spain, in some areas, the two species are found in sympatry (sometimes even on the same plant). Morphological observations are confirmed at the mo-lecular level by sequencing of the mitochondrial Cytochrome c oxidase I standard barcode fragment. Indeed, inter-specific divergence largely exceeded intra-specific divergence and our phylogenetic reconstructions reveal that  Carpocoris medi-terraneus  and  Carpocoris fuscispinus  form two reciprocally monophyletic genetic lineages. A morphological identifica-tion key is proposed for all the European species of the genus  Carpocoris,  to facilitate identification.  Carpocoris fuscispinus  is first time recorded from Portugal.
