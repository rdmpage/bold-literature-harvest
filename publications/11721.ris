N2 - The first analysis of 27 newly sampled P. putrinum strains by two DNA fragments.P. putrinum forms a well separated cluster, divided into five haplogroups.Particular haplogroups may correspond to cryptic species.Their spatial distribution support the both endemicity and ubiquity models with a bias towards the latter.Paramecium putrinum (Claparede & Lachmann 1858) is one of the smallest (80–140 μm long) species of the genus Paramecium. Although it commonly occurs in freshwater reservoirs, no molecular studies of P. putrinum have been conducted to date. Herein we present an assessment of molecular variation in 27 strains collected from widely separated populations by using two selected DNA fragments (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-5′LSU rDNA and COI mtDNA). Both the trees and haplotype networks reconstructed for both genome fragments show that the studied strains of P. putrinum form five main haplogroups. The mean distance between the studied strains is p-distance = 0.007/0.068 (rDNA/COI) and exhibits similar variability as that between P. bursaria syngens. Based on these data, one could hypothesize that the clusters revealed in the present study may correspond to previously reported syngens and that there are at least five cryptic species within P. putrinum.
