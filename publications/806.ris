N2 - Species of the genus Syphacia are considered to have generally co-evolved with their rodent hosts. This study determined partial sequences of the CO1 gene from several species in the genus Syphacia and discuss the relationships between pinworms and their hosts. Syphacia montana, which parasitizes Microtinae, was closely related to S. frederici and S. obvelata, which parasitize Murinae. Although both S. obvelata and S. ohtaorum parasitize rodents in the genus Mus, these two species were not found to be closely related to each other. Syphacia frederici, S. emileromani and S. agraria are all pinworms of the Apodemus species, but genetic affiliation between these three species was not indicated. These facts suggest that the co-evolutionary relationship between species of the genus Syphacia and their host rodents may not so strict and host switching has probably occurred during the course of evolution.
