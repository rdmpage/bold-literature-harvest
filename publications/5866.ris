N2 - A set of polymerase chain reaction primers were designed, which amplify a
c
. 1 kb fragment
of the 18S ribosomal DNA gene, and are specific to the phylum Nematoda. These have
proven useful in isolating nematode genes from samples mixed with other biological
material, particularly with application to DNA barcoding. Optimal reaction conditions are
described. These primers have successfully amplified the correct fragment from a wide
phylogenetic range of nematodes, and have so far generated no sequences from any other
organismal group.
