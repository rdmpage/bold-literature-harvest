N2 - Medicinal plants are the source of a large number of essential drugs in Western medicine and are the basis of herbal medicine, which is not only the primary source of health care for most of the world’s population living in developing countries but also enjoys growing popularity in developed countries. The increased demand for botanical products is met by an expanding industry and accompanied by calls for assurance of quality, efficacy and safety. Plants used as drugs, dietary supplements and herbal medicines are identified at the species level. Unequivocal identification is a critical step at the beginning of an extensive process of quality assurance and is of importance for the characterization of the genetic diversity, phylogeny and phylogeography as well as the protection of endangered species. DNA-based methods have been developed for the identification of medicinal plants. Nuclear and chloroplast DNA is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and the reaction products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis, sequencing, or hybridization with species-specific probes. Genomic fingerprinting can differentiate between individuals, species and populations and is useful for the detection of the homogeneity of the samples and presence of adulterants. Although sequences from single chloroplast or nuclear genes have been useful for differentiation of species, phylogenetic studies often require consideration of DNA sequence data from more than one gene or genomic region. Phytochemical and genetic data are correlated but only the latter normally allow for differentiation at the species level. The generation of molecular ”barcodes” of medicinal plants will be worth the concerted effort of the medicinal plant research community and contribute to the ongoing effort of defining barcodes for every species on earth.
