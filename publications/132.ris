N2 - The 13,738 bp mitochondrial DNA from the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis has been sequenced. It contains two major noncoding regions and 36 genes (12 for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, two for rRNAs and 22 for tRNAs) but a gene for ATPase subunit 8 is missing. All genes are transcribed in the same direction. Putative secondary structures of tRNAs indicate that most of them are conventional clover leaves but the dihydrouridine arm is unpaired in tRNA(Ser(AGN)), tRNA(Ser(UCN)), tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Cys). The base composition at the wobble positions of fourfold degenerate codon families is highly biased toward U and against C.
