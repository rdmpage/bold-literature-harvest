N2 - Despite the impact of some trypanosome species on human and livestock health, the full diversity of trypanosomes in Africa is poorly understood. A recent study examined the prevalence of trypanosomes among a wide variety of wild vertebrates in Cameroon using species-specific PCR tests, but six trypanosome isolates remained unidentified. Here they have been re-examined using fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB) and phylogenetic analysis of glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gGAPDH and 18S ribosomal RNA (rDNA) genes. Isolates from a monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans) and a palm civet (Nandinia binotata) belonged to the Trypanosoma cruzi clade, known previously only from New World and Australian terrestrial mammals, and bats from Africa, Europe and South America. Of the four other isolates, three from antelope were identified as Trypanosoma theileri, and one from a crocodile as T. grayi. This is the first report of trypanosomes of the T. cruzi clade in African terrestrial mammals and expands the clade's known global distribution in terrestrial mammals. Previously it has been hypothesized that African and New World trypanosomes diverged after continental separation, dating the divergence to around 100 million years ago. The new evidence instead suggests that intercontinental transfer occurred well after this, possibly via bats or rodents, allowing these trypanosomes to establish and evolve in African terrestrial mammals, and questioning the validity of calibrating trypanosome molecular trees using continental separation.
