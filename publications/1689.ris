N2 - The leaf beetle genus Trirhabda contains 26 described species from the United States and Canada, feeding on host plants from the families Asteraceae and Hydrophyllaceae. In this study, we present a phylogeny for the genus that was reconstructed from mitochondrial COI and 12S rRNA fragments, nuclear ITS2 rRNA, and morphological characters. Both parsimony and mixed-model Bayesian likelihood analyses were performed. Under both methods, the mitochondrial and nuclear partitions support the same backbone phylogeny, as do the combined data. The utility of the molecular data is contrasted with the low phylogenetic signal among morphological characters. The phylogeny was used to trace the evolution of the host-plant association in Trirhabda. The recovered phylogeny shows that although the host-plant association is phylogenetically conservative, Trirhabda experienced one shift to a distantly related host-plant family, 6 shifts between host-plant tribes, and 6 between genera within tribes. The phylogeny reveals that Trirhabda were plesiomorphically adapted to tolerate complex secondary compounds of its host plants and this adaptation is retained in Trirhabda species, as evidenced by multiple shifts from chemically simpler host plants back to the more complex host plants.
