N2 - A male specimen of the monotypic weevil genus, Prothrombosternus Voss, 1965, so far known on the basis of only five
syntypes from Mt. Meru and Mt. Hanang, Tanzania, is reported from the Rubeho Mountains, Tanzania. The lectotype of
Prothrombosternus tarsalis Voss, 1965 is designated using a male from Mt. Meru. The Rubeho specimen shares the same
external and genital morphological characters with the lectotype (both extensively illustrated) and, therefore, both are considered
conspecific. The DNA barcode of the Rubeho specimen is publicly available at dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-PROTHRO.
All six known specimens of Prothrombosternus are flightless and were found by sifting leaf litter at elevations
between 1833â€“2500 m in wet Afromontane forests. The genus is, therefore, thought to be restricted to this highly fragmented
habitat threatened by human encroachment. Presence of the genus on both geologically old (Rubeho Mountains;
>10Ma) and young (Mt. Meru and Mt. Hanang volcanoes, <2Ma) forested highlands suggests presently unknown means
of dispersal. The phylogenetic position of the genus is unknown and its taxonomic placement in Cycloterini cannot be
presently tested.
