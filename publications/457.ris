N2 - In this study, we present a molecular phylogeny for the west Palaearctic Helicidae sensu lato based on sequence data from two mitochondrial (COI, 16S rDNA) and two nuclear (ITS-1, 18S rDNA) genes. Maximum likelihood analysis and Bayesian inference revealed well supported monophyletic clades partly conflicting traditional classifications. Based on these results, we propose the following system. The Western Palaearctic Helicidae s.l. consist of two families, Helicidae and Hygromiidae. Within the Helicidae, three well supported subfamilies can be recognised: the Helicinae, Ariantinae, and Helicodontinae. The Hygromiidae consist of three clades: the Hygromiinae, the Helicellinae, and a yet unnamed clade comprising the genera Sphincterochila and Cochlicella. We then used the phylogeny to study the evolution of anatomical, and ecological characters traditionally used for systematic classification. In the Helicidae s.l., two independent evolutionary transitions to life in xeric environments occurred, which allowed the occupation of new niches with a subsequent radiation of the Helicellinae-Cochlicella/Sphincterochila clade and the Helicinae. Whereas, the multiplication of the Glandulae mucosae is a synapomorphy of the Hygromiidae, the lovedart sac apparatus is present in all groups and thus, the trait cannot provide a synapomorphy for either families or subfamilies. Additionally, we evaluated the use of structural molecular genetic characters for taxonomic assessment. The presence of an unique loop region of the 16S rDNA gene and a short tandem repeat in the ITS-1 region provide independent evidence for the monophyly of these major two groups, and can be used for preliminary classification.
