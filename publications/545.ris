N2 - Tedania ignis (Duchassaing and Michelotti, 1864), the fire sponge, is common throughout the tropical western Atlantic, and is a popular species for studies of ecology, larval biology, and chemistry. T. ignis is readily consumed by seagrass-dwelling starfish, and so finding sponges similar to this species in a seagrass meadow provoked closer scrutiny. A variety of ecological, morphological, and molecular traits consistently and unambiguously distinguish T. ignis from a cryptic sympatric congener, here described as Tedania klausi, n. sp. Starfish that consume T. ignis reject T. klausi, and angelfish consume T. klausi less quickly. In Belize, T. ignis individuals transplanted to a seagrass meadow inhabited by T. klausi were consumed by starfish, and individuals of T. klausi transplanted to a mangrove-lined creek in which T. ignis flourishes, died. In Panama, many individuals of T. klausi were diseased in May 2004, while adjacent individuals of T. ignis were unaffected. Spicule types are the same in the two forms, and sizes overlap; but within individuals, the relative sizes of styles and tylotes differ in a pattern that distinguishes the two forms. Comparison of DNA sequences for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) revealed that 8 single nucleotide mutations consistently differ between the two forms regardless of habitat (seagrass vs. mangrove) and geographically separated sites (Belize vs. Panama).
