N2 - We assess the diversity of Ptychadena species in Rwanda based on re-examination of voucher specimens in museum collections and our own data from recent assessment of the species composition of amphibian communities in Rwanda. We recognize five species which we allocate to the following available names: P. anchietae, P. chrysogaster, P. nilotica, P. porosissima, and P. uzungwensis. We did not find evidence for the presence of P. grandisonae and P. oxyrhynchus which have been listed for the country. The five species can be distinguished by quantitative morphometrics (discriminant analysis, success rate: 100 %) and a number of qualitative characters of external morphology. We provide an identification key to the Rwandan species and describe the morphology of each species in detail. The taxonomic status and the phylogenetic position of Ptychadena chrysogaster are further assessed based on the partial sequence of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA. The species differs genetically from available homologous sequences from congeners by an uncorrected p distance of at least 4.2 % and appears to be most closely related to specimens assigned to P. porosissima, P. mahnerti, “P. aff. uzungwensis” and “P. aff. bibroni”.
