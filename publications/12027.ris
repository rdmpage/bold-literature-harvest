N2 - Twenty-five strains of monoverticillate Penicillium species were isolated from dissected guts and fecal pellets of leaf-eating caterpillars reared in the Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica, or from washed leaves of their food plants. Phylogenetic analyses of β-tubulin, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, translation elongation factor 1-α and calmodulin gene sequences revealed two phylogenetically distinct, undescribed species closely related to P. sclerotiorum. Penicillium mallochii was isolated from Rothschildia lebeau and Citheronia lobesis (Saturniidae) and their food plant Spondias mombin (Anacardiaceae) and P. guanacastense from Eutelia sp. (Noctuidae). Both fungi produce greenish conidial masses and orange pigments in agar culture, have smooth-walled, monoverticillate conidiophores with moderately vesiculate apices, and globose to subglobose conidia. The species morphologically resemble P. sclerotiorum but differ subtly in vesicle width and conidial shape.
