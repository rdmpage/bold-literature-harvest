N2 - We determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the Korean hairstreak, Coreana raphaelis (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). The entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule was 15,314 bp long. The C. raphaelis genes were in the same order and orientation as the completely sequenced mitogenomes of other lepidopteran species, except for the presence of an extra copy of tRNA(Ser)(AGN). High similarity in primary sequence and secondary structure between the two tandemly located copies of the tRNA(Ser)(AGN) suggest a recent duplication of an original single tRNA(Ser)(AGN). The DHU arm of the two copies of tRNA(Ser)(AGN) formed a simple loop as seen in many other metazoan mt tRNA(Ser)(AGN). The putative initiation codon for the C. raphaelis COI gene appears to be a tetranucleotide, TTAG, found commonly in the sequenced lepidopterans. ATPase8, ATPase6, ND4L and ND6 genes, which are next to another protein-coding gene at their 3' end all had the sequences potential to form a hairpin structure, suggesting the importance of such a structure for precise cleavage of the mature protein-coding genes.
