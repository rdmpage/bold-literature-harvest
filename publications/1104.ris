N2 - The complete sequence of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) mitochondrial genome has been determined. The entire sequence is 16665 base pairs (bp) in length, with a gene content (13 protein-coding, two ribosomal RNA [rRNA] and 22 transfer RNA [tRNA] genes) and order conforming to that observed in most other vertebrates. Base composition and codon usage have been detailed. Nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of the 13 protein-coding genes from Atlantic salmon have been compared with their counterparts in rainbow trout. A putative structure for the origin of L-strand replication (O(L)) is proposed, and sequence features of the control region (D-loop) are described.
