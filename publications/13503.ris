N2 - A new tribe of braconid wasps provisionally included in the Rhyssalinae, Laibaleini trib. nov., type genus Laibalea gen. nov. (type species Laibalea enigmatica sp. nov.), from Kenya and the Central African Republic, is described. A molecular dataset, with emphasis on basally derived taxa based on four gene fragments (28S D2â€“D3 expansion region, COI barcode, elongation factor 1-alpha and 16S ribosomal DNA), was analysed both alone and in combination with a morphological dataset. Molecular phylogenetic placement of the new species into an existing subfamily is complicated by the extreme sequence divergence of the three sequences obtained for Laibalea. In both the combined sequence analysis and the combined DNA plus morphological tree, Laibalea is recovered as a sister group to the Rhyssalinae plus all non-cyclostome lineage braconids excluding Mesostoinae, Maxfischeriinae and Aphidiinae. A consensus of morphological characters and molecular analyses suggests inclusion of Laibalea either in the otherwise principally Holarctic subfamily Rhyssalinae or perhap more basally, in the principally Gondwanan Mesostoinae s.l., although we cannot exclude the possibility that it might represent a separate basal lineage. We place Laibalea in its own tribe, provisionally included in Rhyssalinae. The DNA sequence data are presented for several genera for the first time. Avga, the type genus of Avgini, is shown not to belong to Mesostoinae s.l. or Hormiinae, but its exact relationships remain uncertain. The generic compositions of Rhyssalinae and Mesostoinae s.l. are revised. Anachyra, Apoavga, Neptihormius, Neoavga and Opiopterus are shown to belong to Mesostoinae s.s. A key to the tribes of Rhyssalinae is provided.
