N2 - The phylogenetic relationships in an endemic group of Malagasy 'assassin spiders' (Araneae, Archaeidae: Eriauchenius) called the gracilicollis group, are inferred from mitochondrial 12S, 16S and COI DNA sequence data. Archaeid spiders of Madagascar have evolved varying degrees of elongation in the cephalic area. These molecular data support the monophyly of the gracilicollis group. The evolution of the cephalic area is examined by performing an ancestral character reconstruction on this character, which reveals that the cephalic area is elongating independently. The biogeography of the gracilicollis group reveals an east-west split of the clade on Madagascar.
