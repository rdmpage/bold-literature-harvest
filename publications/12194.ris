N2 - East Antarctic octopods were identified by sequencing mtCOI and using four analytical approaches: Neighbor-joining by Kimura-2-Parameter-based distances, character-based, BLAST, and Bayesian Inference of Phylogeny. Although the distance-based analytical approaches identified a high proportion of the sequences (99.5% to genus and 88.1% to species level), these results are undermined by the absence of a clear gap between intra- and interspecific variation. The character-based approach gave highly conflicting results compared to the distance-based methods and failed to identify apomorphic characters for many of the species. While a DNA independent approach is necessary for validation of the method comparisons, crude morphological observations give early support to the distance-based results and indicate extensive range expansions of several species compared to previous studies. Furthermore, the use of distance-based phylogenetic methods nevertheless group specimens into plausible species clades that are highly useful in non-taxonomical or non-systematic studies.
