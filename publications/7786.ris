N2 - DNA barcoding is a growing concept from 2003, used to screen the large - scale genes , assign unknown individuals and discovery of new species. Currently use of molecular markers (e.g., allozymes, rDNA, and mtDNA) for these purposes w as increasing. Our research work is aimed to find the phylogenic information and evolutionary relationship to distinguish the species of Coilia reynaldi , Thryssa purava , Thryssa setirostris , Ambassis kopsii , Terapon jarbua , Lutjanus johni , Boleophthalmus boddarti , Pseudapocryptes elongates , Eleotris fusca , and Taenioides buchanani to evaluating the promise and molecular diagnostics of individuals relative to described taxa, and DNA led discovery of new species. Both are inherently phylogenetic and rely on a solid taxonomic foundation, including adequate sampling of variation within species and inclusion proves the utility of mt DNA COI gene sequence based approach in identifying fish species at a faster pace
