N2 - To study the phylogeny and select a DNA barcode for classification, the mitochondrial COI genes of eight lobster species, belong to the genus Panulirus, distributing along the coast of China were sequenced and analyzed. The genetic distance was calculated using MEGA4.0, and the phylogenetic trees were constructed with NeighborJoining (NJ) and Maximum Parsimony (MP) methods. The obtained COI gene fragments were 731 bp with GC contents ranging from 40.2% to 44.5%. The intraspecific genetic distances of these eight species, ranging from 0.00～0.057 with an average of 0.016, are small, and the interspecific genetic distances, ranging from 0.124 to 0.228 with an average of 0.185, are more than ten times higher than those of intraspecies. Eight species of Panulirus can be divided into two branches by NJ tree and MP tree: P. japonicus,P. longpies and P. penicillatus belong to a same branch; P. stimpsonic, P. polyphagus, P. versicolor, P. ornatus and P. homarus belong to the other. The results indicated that the COI gene could be a useful DNA barcode for taxonomic identification of lobsters.
