N2 - Background: Species diversity on our planet follows complex patterns governed by historical, physical, and biological parameters, resulting in the classification of well-defined ecoregions usually dominated by specific plant communities. As spiders are predators, they are not directly dependent on plants for nutrition but may have similar distributional patterns. Until now, comprehensive analysis of these patterns has been prohibited by arduous specimen identification and a high incidence of cryptic species. However, DNA barcoding can circumnavigate many of these barriers by delineating species and accelerating specimen identification. We utilize this method to build a DNA barcode reference library for Nearctic Wolf spiders (Lycosidae), one of the four largest spider families in North America, and investigate distribution patterns across the Nearctic ecoregions. Results: In total, 7394 DNA barcode sequences were generated from 170 morphologically identified species (70% of the Nearctic Lycosidae), representing 239 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). Adult specimens were not available for 19 BINs and were assigned interim names. In total, 30 species shared BINs, two were distinguished with shallow (2%) intraspecific sequence divergence (i.e., BIN splits). Seventy of the 75 Nearctic World Wildlife Fund ecoregions were represented by 1â€“42 BINs (and 11 represented by >20 BINs), which permitted a thorough exploration of distributional patterns. Significance: We present a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library for over two-thirds of the Nearctic wolf spider fauna. The results confirm that DNA barcodes are an effective tool for the identification of Nearctic wolf spiders. With the exception of several cases of potentially cryptic species, BINs and species correspond well, suggesting that rapid and accurate estimates of spider diversity are possible with this approach. It has also permitted the first attempt to resolve the distributional pattern for this large Nearctic family of spiders.
