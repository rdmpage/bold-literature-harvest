N2 - Intra- and interspecific variation in a 658 bp long part of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene of the mitochondrial genome, i.e. a suggested ‘DNA barcode’, was assessed in four north-west European species of the marine tubificid genus Tubificoides: T. benedii, T. amplivasatus, T. heterochaetus and T. kozloffi. Within species mean genetic distance was from 0.10% (T. amplivasatus) to 0.14% (T. benedii), between species from 19.3% to 22.9%. For T. benedii and T. amplivasatus, material collected in two separate areas, The Sound between Denmark and Sweden, and the Koster area about 330 km to the north along the Swedish west coast, showed a geographically random distribution of COI haplotypes, suggesting that each of these two species forms a continuous population in southern Scandinavia. We conclude that the COI gene is suitable as a barcode marker for the secure identification of these species, at least within the area investigated. Tubificoides heterochaetus is reported for the first time from Denmark.
