N2 - Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) is a natural enemy of pest mites used worldwide in many crops. Its correct identification is thus essential to ensure biological control success. The present study aimed to characterize molecular and morphological intraspecific variations for assisting in the diagnosis of the species and to build baseline information about expected variations within a commercially important phytoseiid species. Morphological and molecular [12S rRNA, cytochrome b mitochondrial (mt)DNA, and internal transcribed spacer] analyses were carried out on fourteen populations collected worldwide and on one mass-reared strain. The genetic distances between the specimens of N. californicus and another related species were high and no overlap was observed, sustaining the reliability of such molecular methods for assisting a specific diagnosis. Furthermore, the genetic distances between populations of N. californicus were very low and overlap between intra- and interpopulations distances was observed, except for two populations collected in France (Marsillargues and Midi-Pyrénées). The high mitochondrial differentiation between these two latter populations and the others questions their specific status: do they belong to the species N. californicus or to another cryptic species? However, using nuclear DNA marker analyses, no distinct differences were observed. Furthermore, even if significant morphological differences were observed between the populations, these differences were very small and the standard errors within each population were very low. We thus concluded that all the populations studied belong to the species N. californicus, despite unexpected high mitochondrial variations. The present study thus displays the importance of an integrative taxonomic approach for avoiding misidentifications. A discussion on morphological and mtDNA variations in relation to diagnostic reliability is developped.
