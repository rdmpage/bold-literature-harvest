N2 - Genomic DNA from old tissue was isolated by the phenol/chloroform method. The COI and 16S rDNA were amplified and sequenced by two pairs of special primers. Genetic variation, genetic distance and phylogenetic tree analysis were studied by MEGA 3.0 software. The homologous sequences were blasted from the NCBI GenBank. It can be concluded that the sample numbered YTU073 might be Grapsus albolineatus in the study.
