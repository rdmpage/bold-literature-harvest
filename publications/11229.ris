N2 - The Agabinae, with more than 350 species, is one of the most diverse lineages of diving beetles (Dytiscidae). Using the mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I we present a phylogenetic analysis based on 107 species drawn mostly from the four main Holarctic genera. Two of these genera (Ilybius and Ilybiosoma) are consistently recovered as monophyletic with strong support, Platambus is never recovered as monophyletic, and Agabus is found paraphyletic with respect to several of the species groups of Platambus. Basal relationships among the main lineages are poorly defined, although within each of them relationships are in general robust and very consistent across the parameter space, and in agreement with previous morphological analyses. In each of the two most diverse lineages (Ilybius and Agabus including part of Platambus) there is a basal split between Palearctic and Nearctic clades, estimated to have occurred in the late Eocene. The Palearctic clade in turn splits into a Western Palearctic clade and a clade containing mostly Eastern Palearctic species, and assumed to be ancestrally Eastern Palearctic but with numerous transitions to a Holarctic or Nearctic distribution. These results suggest an asymmetry in the colonization routes, as there are very few cases of transcontinental range expansions originating from the Nearctic or the Western Palearctic. According to standard clock estimates, we do not find any transcontinental shift during the Pliocene, but numerous speciation events within each of the continental or subcontinental regions.
