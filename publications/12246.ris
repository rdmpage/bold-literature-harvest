N2 - INTRODUCTION Nested Patch polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifies a large number (greater than 90) of targeted loci from genomic DNA simultaneously in the same reaction. These amplified loci can then be sequenced on a second-generation sequencing machine to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and mutations. The reaction is highly specific: 90% of sequencing reads match targeted loci. Nested Patch PCR can be performed on many samples in parallel, and by using sample-specific DNA barcodes, these can be pooled and sequenced in a single reaction. Thus, the Nested Patch PCR protocol that is described here provides an easy workflow to identify SNPs and mutations across many targeted loci for many samples in parallel.
