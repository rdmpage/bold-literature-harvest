N2 - In the present work, a comparative molecular study of Ctenocephalides felis and Ctenocephalides canis isolated from dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) from different geographical regions (Spain, Iran and South Africa) was carried out. We found morphological variations in C. felis that do not correspond with molecular differences. The Internal Transcribed Spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1, ITS2) and 18S rRNA partial gene, and cytochrome c‐oxidase 1 (cox1) mtDNA partial gene sequences were determined to clarify the taxonomic status of these two species, and to assess interpopulation variation and interspecific sequence differences. In addition, a comparative phylogenetic study with other species of fleas using Bayesian, Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analysis was performed. The 18S rRNA partial gene fragment was useful neither to discriminate C. canis and C. felis nor to infer phylogenetic relationships at this level, whereas ITS1 and ITS2 assessed for specific determination in the genus Ctenocephalides. The cox1 mtDNA sequences of C. felis revealed three main haplotypes and we suggest that there has been introgression of C. canis cox1 mtDNA into C. felis by Wolbachia pipientis. Based on cox1 sequences, restriction mapping identified many endonucleases that could be used to delineate different haplotypes of C. felis and to differentiate C. felis and C. canis.
