N2 - The freshwater leech Helobdella europaea Kutschera 1987 was discovered twenty years ago in Germany and described as a new species. Here, we show that this leech is genetically identical with the Australian species Helobdella papillornata (CO-I-mt-DNA sequence identity of alignment positions: 98%). We conclude that H. europaea (syn. H. papillornata) represents an introduced annelid that occupies the same ecological niche as the common European leech H. stagnalis L.
