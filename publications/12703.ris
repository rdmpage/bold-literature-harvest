N2 - Nujiang River (NR), an essential component of the biodiversity hotspot of the Mountains of 
Southwest China, possesses a characteristic fish fauna and contains endemic species. Although 
previous studies on fish diversity in the NR have primarily consisted of listings of the fish species 
observed during field collections, in our study, we DNA-barcoded 1139 specimens belonging 
to 46 morphologically distinct fish species distributed throughout the NR basin by employing 
multiple analytical approaches. According to our analyses, DNA barcoding is an efficient method 
for the identification of fish by the presence of barcode gaps. However, three invasive species 
are characterized by deep conspecific divergences, generating multiple lineages and Operational 
Taxonomic Units (OTUs), implying the possibility of cryptic species. At the other end of the spectrum, 
ten species (from three genera) that are characterized by an overlap between their intra- and 
interspecific genetic distances form a single genetic cluster and share haplotypes. The neighbor-joining phenogram, Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) 
identified 43 putative species, while the General Mixed Yule-coalescence (GMYC) identified five more 
OTUs. Thus, our study established a reliable DNA barcode reference library for the fish in the NR and 
sheds new light on the local fish diversity.
