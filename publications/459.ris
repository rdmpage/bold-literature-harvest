N2 - The spider family Pholcidae comprises a large number of mainly tropical, web-weaving spiders, and is among the most diverse and dominant spider groups in the world. The phylogeny of this family has so far been investigated exclusively using morphological data. Here, we present the first molecular data for the family analyzed in a phylogenetic context. Four different gene regions (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, 28S rRNA) and 45 morphological characters were scored for 31 pholcid and three outgroup taxa. The data were analyzed both for individual genes, combined molecular data, and molecular plus morphological data, using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Some of the phylogenetic hypotheses obtained previously using morphology alone were also supported by our results, like the monophyly of pholcines and of the New World clade. On the other hand, some of the previous hypotheses could be discarded with some confidence (monophyly of holocnemines, the position of Priscula), and still others need further investigation (the position of holocnemines, ninetines, and Metagonia). The data obtained provide an excellent basis for future investigations of phylogenetic patterns both within the family and among spider families.
