N2 - The Euptychiina is one of the more diverse lineages of satyrine butterflies, represented by over 300 species. The first phylogenetic analyses of the subtribe is presented based on 2506 aligned nucleotide sequences obtained from 69 individuals spanning 28 ingroup genera and nine outgroup genera. Two genes were used, the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase 1 (1268 bp) and the nuclear gene elongation factor-1alpha (1238 bp). The subtribe is never recovered as monophyletic in analyses using parsimony, maximum likelihood, or Bayesian inference. Several euptychiine genera are placed basal to the ingroup, but support is found only for Euptychia and Oressinoma. Three main lineages within the ingroup were clearly defined and many taxonomic groupings within the clades strongly supported. The majority of genera tested were paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Based on results presented here and novel host use, a close relationship of Euptychia to the Indo-Australian tribe Ragadiini is hypothesized. Origins of the group remain unclear, but the basal position of most of the Nearctic genera is discussed.
