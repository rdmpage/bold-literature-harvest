N2 - The complex of butterfly taxa close to Melitaea didyma includes the traditionally recognized species M.
didyma, M. didymoides and M. sutschana, the taxa that were recognized as species only relatively recently
(M. latonigena, M. interrupta, M. chitralensis and M. mixta) as well as numerous described subspecies and
forms with unclear taxonomic status. Here analysis of mitochondrial DNA barcodes is used to demonstrate
that this complex is monophyletic group consisting of at least 12 major haplogroups strongly differentiated
with respect to the gene COI. Six of these haplogroups are shown to correspond to six of the
above-mentioned species (M. didymoides, M. sutschana, M. latonigena, M. interrupta, M. chitralensis and
M. mixta). It is hypothesized that each of the remaining six haplogroups also represents a distinct species
(M. mauretanica, M. occidentalis, M. didyma, M. neera, M. liliputana and M. turkestanica), since merging
these haplogroups would result in a polyphyletic assemblage and the genetic distances between them are
comparable with those found between the other six previously recognized species.
