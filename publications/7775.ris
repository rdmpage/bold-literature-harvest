N2 - Dragonflies are the bio indicators of the aquatic ecosystem. Knowledge and studies on the diversity of dragonflies in
India is very high. Identification by traditional taxonomy often leads to misidentification. Incidence of sexual
dimorphism is found to be high particularly in the Libellulidae and Aeshnidae family. In order to resolve the above
mentioned problem, the accurate identification of the dragonflies was carried out by DNA barcoding using COI
gene. In the present study, selected dragonfly species (Bradinopyga geminata, Crocothemis servilia, Diplacodes
trivialis and Anaciaeschna jaspidea) of the family of Libellulidae and Aeshnidae were taken and along with three
other evident species (Pantala flavescens, Orthetrum sabina, and Brachythemis contaminata) were retrieved from
GenBank. The phylogenetic tree was created using NJ (Neighbour Joining) method to determine the origin and
evolutionary relationships of the species. Similarity search was performed and conformed species were submitted to
the NCBI and BOLD database for species authentication. The present study concluded that the DNA barcoding is an
invaluable tool for the authentication of the species. Storage of this nucleotide information in a database like BOLD
would greatly help in the identification up to sub species level.
