N2 - Invasive individuals from the pest species Jacobaea vulgaris show different allocation patterns in defence
and growth compared with native individuals. To examine if these changes are caused by fast evolution, it is
necessary to identify native source populations and compare these with invasive populations. For this
purpose, we are in need of intraspecific polymorphic markers. We therefore sequenced the complete chloroplast
genomes of 12 native and 5 invasive individuals of J. vulgaris with next generation sequencing and
discovered single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites. This is the first study in which the
chloroplast genome of that many individuals within a single species was sequenced. Thirty-two SNPs and 34
microsatellite regions were found. For none of the individuals, differences were found between the inverted
repeats. Furthermore, being the first chloroplast genome sequenced in the Senecioneae clade, we compared
it with four other members of the Asteraceae family to identify new regions for phylogentic inference
within this clade and also within the Asteraceae family. Five markers (ndhC-trnV, ndhC-atpE, rps18-rpl20,
clpP and psbM-trnD) contained parsimony-informative characters higher than 2%. Finally, we compared
two procedures of preparing chloroplast DNA for next generation sequencing.
