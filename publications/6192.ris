N2 - This paper contains the first reports of Veleroa magneana in the Atlantic Ocean, Chylocladia schneideri outside of its type locality in Puerto Rico, and Verdigellas peltata and Cladocephalus luteofuscus from shallow water. Also reported are new northern limits of distribution for Chondria leptacremon, Dasya antillarum, Laurencia caraibica, Lomentaria corallicola, Myriogramme prostrata and Udotea caribaea as well as the first four mentioned. Fertile gametophytes are documented for Ptilothamnion speluncarum for the first time from the type locality. Molecular evidence shows that Halymenia pseudofloresii, a species with its type locality in Bermuda, is sister to Halymenia floresii, the generitype, in the present analysis. More critically, molecular data establish that H. pseudofloresii has a broad range of morphological variation encompassing that displayed by true H. floresii and bringing into question reports of the latter from Bermudian waters.
