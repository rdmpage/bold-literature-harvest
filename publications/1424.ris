N2 - We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome for the rock bream, Oplegnathus fasciatus (Perciformes, Oplegnathidae). This mitochondrial genome, consisting of 16,511 base pairs (bp), encoded genes for 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and a noncoding control region like those found in other vertebrates, with the gene order identical to that of typical vertebrates. Most of the genes of O. fasciatus were encoded on the H-strand, while the ND6 and eight tRNA (Gln, Ala, Asn, Cys, Tyr, Ser (UCN), Glu and Pro) genes were encoded on the L-strand. The reading frames of two pairs of genes overlapped: ATPase 8 and 6 and ND4L and ND4 by ten and seven nucleotides, respectively. The origin of L-strand replication in O. fasciatus was in a cluster of five tRNA genes (WANCY) and was 41 nucleotides in length. The conserved motif (5'-GCGGG-3') was found at the base of the stem within the tRNA-Cys gene. A major noncoding region between the tRNA-Pro and tRNA-Phe genes (835 bp) was considered to be the control region (D-loop). Within this sequence, we identified a termination-associated sequence and a conserved sequence block characteristic to this region. In most parsimony analyses, the O. fasciatus was positioned in the clade including Emmelichthyidae, Lutjanidae, Percidae, Centrarchidae, and Sparidae, with 100% bootstrap support for their divergence.
