N2 - Identification of fish species have so far been carried out mostly by classical morpho-taxonomy. In the present study, however, an attempt has been taken to identify two species of fishes Ulua mentalis and Pinjalo pinjalo of order Perciformes which happens to be the first record in Odisha coast Bay of Bengal, India during the year 2015, using DNA barcoding technique for reconfirmation over conventional morpho-taxonomy. During recent past, study of molecular-taxonomical profile of mitochondrial DNA in general and Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) gene in particular has gained enormous importance for accurate identification of species. In the present study, the partial COI sequence of Ulua mentalis and Pinjalo pinjalo were generated. Analysis using the COI gene produced phylogenetic trees in concurrence with other multi gene studies and we came across the identical phylogenetic relationship considering Neighbor-Joining and Maximum Likelihood tree. Moreover, these molecular data set further testified in Bayesian framework to reevaluate the exact taxonomic groupings within the family. Surprisingly, Ulua mentalis and Pinjalo pinjalo seems to be closely related to their sister taxa.
