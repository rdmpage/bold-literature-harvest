N2 - Phylogenies of major groups of insects based on both morphological
and molecular data have sometimes been contentious, often lacking
the data to distinguish between alternative views of relationships.
This paucity of data is often due to real biological and historical
causes, such as shortness of time spans between divergences for evolution to occur and long time spans after divergences for subsequent
evolutionary changes to obscure the earlier ones. Another reason
for dif&#64257;culty in resolving some of the relationships using molecular data is the limited spectrum of genes so far developed for phylogeny estimation. For this latter issue, there is cause for current
optimism owing to rapid increases in our knowledge of comparative
genomics. At least some historical patterns of divergence may, however, continue to defy our attempts to completely reconstruct them
with con&#64257;dence, at least using current strategies.
