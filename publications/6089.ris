N2 - Over the past decade, numerous molecular phylogenetic studies uncovered cryptic diversity within the Copepoda, yet very few investigations focused on symbiotic copepods. Here we report mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I diversity in the cosmopolitan elasmobranch symbiont Nesippus orientalis off the KwaZulu-Natal coast of South Africa. Analysis of partial COI sequences of copepods sampled from a diversity of shark hosts, revealed the presence of two divergent clades. Diversity within the clades does not appear to be structured based on host species, host individual, geographic locality or time of sampling. However, divergence between the two clades seems to be related to host species. Phylogenetic analyses of representatives from the two clades, along with Nesippus spp., Caligus spp. and Lepeophtheirus spp. outgroups, further supports the distinction between the two clades. Future molecular phylogenetic investigations of widespread copepod symbionts most likely will reveal far greater levels of biodiversity than currently recognized.
