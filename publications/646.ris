N2 - The complete mitochondrial genome of the phytoseiid Metaseiulus occidentalis (Arthropoda: Chelicerata: Acari: Phytoseiidae) has been sequenced. It is 24,961 bp in length and contains a 14,695-bp unique region, a 345-bp triplicated region, and a 9921-bp duplicated region, in that order. The A+T content of the unique region is 76.9% and contains 11 protein coding (COI-III; ATP6-8; CytB; ND1, 2, 4, 5 and 4L), two ribosomal RNA (srRNA and lrRNA), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and two copies of D-loop control sequence. Two genes (ND3 and 6) appear to be missing, but there is a large intergenic spacer (390 bp) present, which could contain ND3 if a different codon usage is employed. The gene order is completely different from the pattern in all other known chelicerates, including the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus [Lavrov et al., Mol. Biol. Evol., 2000; 17:813-824]. All the inferred tRNA genes are missing the TPsiC arm, but this arm has fused with the variable arm to generate a TV replacement loop. The duplicated region (9921 bp) contains 18 genes in the same order as in the unique region from CytB to tRNA-His, plus one copy of D-loop control sequence (311 bp) and a partial tRNA-Leu2 sequence (34 bp). The small triplicated region (345 bp) contains a D-loop control sequence (311 bp) and a partial tRNA-Leu2 sequence (34 bp). Because of these anomalies, amplifying sequences posed technical difficulties, but were accomplished by using a primer-walking strategy and increasing the AT content to 75% in the high-fidelity PCR dNTP mix. This is the first phytoseiid mitochondrial genome to be completely sequenced and the largest (25 kb) detected from the Chelicerata.
