N2 - We describe a new species of Afrotropical reed frog, genus Hyperolius (Hyperoliidae), from Salonga National Park in the
central Congo basin, Democratic Republic of Congo. Males and females have similar colour and pattern and are easily
distinguished from other taxa by a relatively short and broad, bright yellow (in life), dorsolateral line ending in the sacral
region and the presence of a light spot on the heel. In a 16S mitochondrial rRNA phylogeny, it clusters with samples
allocable to the Cinnamon-belly reed frog, H. cinnamomeoventris. The new species, along with other morphologically
well distinguished taxa, splits H. cinnamomeoventris into different non-sister clades. We discuss paraphyly of this reed
frog in a taxonomic framework.
