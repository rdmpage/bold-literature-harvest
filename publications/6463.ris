N2 - Molecular techniques such as DNA barcoding have become popular in assisting species identification especially for cryptic species complexes. We have analysed data from a 468-bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from 200 specimens of 12 species of endemic New Zealand leafroller moths (Tortricidae) from the genera Planotortrix and Ctenopseustis to assess whether the DNA barcoding region can distinguish these species. Among the 200 sequences analysed, 72 haplotypes were recovered, with each genus forming a separate major clade. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods were used to test whether species fell into reciprocally monophyletic clades. The optimal phylogeny showed that four species within the genus Ctenopseustis (C. obliquana, C. herana, C. filicis and C. fraterna) and three within Planotortrix (P. octo, P. excessana and P. avicenniae) are polyphyletic. Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests rejected a null hypothesis of monophyly for the species C. obliquana, C. herana, P. octo and P. excessana. Comparisons of within and between species levels of sequence divergence for the same set of seven species showed cases where maximum levels of within-species divergence were greater than some levels of between-species divergence. DNA barcoding using this region of the COI gene is able to distinguish the two genera and some species within each genus; however, many species cannot be identified using this method. Finally, we discuss the possible reasons for this polyphyly, including incomplete lineage sorting, introgression, horizontal gene transfer and incorrect taxonomy.
