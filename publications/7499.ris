N2 - Hydrurus foetidus is a geographically widespread alga commonly detected as 2–10 cm thalli in mountain streams in early
spring, and also in lowland rivers at latitudes where seasonal conditions are appropriate for this cold-water species. Reaching
macroscopic dimensions but with a pronounced phenotypic plasticity, this species is not typical for the golden algae
(Chrysophyceae) – they are almost exclusively microscopic organisms, best known as micro- or nanoplankton in fresh water.
Other sessile multicellular members are less conspicuous in nature, and rarely detected and sampled for further investigation.
Therefore, the phylogenetic position of Hydrurus within the Chrysophyceae is not clear and has been disputed. We determined
the 18S and 28S rDNA subunit sequences from a typical H. foetidus sampled at Finse, Hardangervidda mountain plateau, in
south Norway. Phylogenetic trees inferred from concatenated 18S and 28S sequences, including representatives of all known
groups of heterokonts, safely confirmed Hydrurus as a chrysophyte. Extending the taxon sampling to include nearly all
available 18S chrysophyte sequences from cultured species and environmental DNA, our analysis placed H. foetidus within a
separate, well-defined clade (here named the Hydrurus-clade) dominated by environmental sequences and poorly defined
strains of chrysophytes in culture, mostly from cold environments. The environmental sequences derived from other mountainous
regions showed high similarity and may represent homologous or closely related species.
