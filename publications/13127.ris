N2 - Until now, there has been difficulty assigning names to animal barcode sequences isolated directly from eDNA in a rapid, high-throughput manner, providing a measure of confidence for each assignment. To address this gap, we have compiled nearly 1 million marker gene DNA barcode sequences appropriate for classifying chordates, arthropods, and flag members of other major eukaryote groups. We show that the RDP na√Øve Bayesian classifier can assign the same number of queries 19 times faster than the popular BLAST top hit method and reduce the false positive rate by two-thirds. As reference databases become more representative of current species diversity, confidence in taxonomic assignments should continue to improve. We recommend that investigators can improve the performance of species-level assignments immediately by supplementing existing reference databases with full-length DNA barcode sequences from representatives of local fauna.
