N2 - We report here the complete nucleotide sequence of the 23.5-kb mitochondrial genome from the yeast Kluyveromyces thermotolerans. It encodes, all on the same DNA strand, three subunits of cytochrome oxidase (COX1, COX2 and COX3), three subunits of ATP synthetase (ATP6, ATP8 and ATP9), the apocytochrome b (COB), the ribosomal protein VAR1, 24 tRNAs, the small and large ribosomal RNAs, and the RNA subunit of RNase P. Three intronic ORFs are present within the COX1 gene group I introns. The K. thermotolerans mitochondrial genome is very similar to the Candida glabrata mitochondrial genome, as judged from clusters of gene order, gene transcription units and sequence similarities. Interestingly, the predicted secondary structure of the abnormal tRNAThr1 contains 10 nucleotides in its anticodon loop. This sequence is available under EMBL Accession No. AJ634268.
