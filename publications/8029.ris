N2 - The octocoral fauna inhabiting the shallow waters (<50 m) of the eastern Pacific has been the subject of renewed interest, and the taxonomy of the most important genera in the region has been reviewed and clarified. Many new species have been described, significantly increasing the known biological diversity of the region. Despite their importance as potential sister-groups of Caribbean octocorals, the phylogenetic relationships of eastern Pacific octocorals remain poorly studied. Here, using partial mitochondrial MutS and igr1-COI sequences, we provide a phylogenetic assessment of a broad sample of eastern Pacific shallow-water octocorals and investigate their phylogenetic relationships with Caribbean gorgonians. We corroborate the monophyly of Pacifigorgia, Leptogorgia and Eugorgia and provide evidence of a close relationship between Swiftia and Psammogorgia, currently placed in Plexauridae. In addition, the phylogenies obtained here provide insights into the historical biogeography and phylogenetic diversity of the eastern Pacific octocoral assemblages and on character evolution among this diverse faunal assemblage. Finally, we evaluate the classification power of DNA barcoding for identifying species of shallow-water eastern Pacific octocorals and assess the use of a nuclear intron (SRP54) to supplement traditional mitochondrial barcodes in this group of organisms.
