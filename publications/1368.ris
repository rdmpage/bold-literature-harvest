N2 - Several species of freshwater unionid mussels in the genus Lampsilis exhibit a remarkable reproductive strategy. Female mussels of these species enclose their larvae in a minnow-like lure, called a 'superconglutinate', to attract piscivorous fishes. When a fish attempts to ingest the superconglutinate the lure ruptures and the larvae are released to parasitize the fish. Of the four species of mussel which exhibit this strategy and are endemic to the Gulf Coast drainages of the southeastern United States, three are protected under the Endangered Species Act, and one is recognized as imperiled. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA and the first subunit of the cytochrome oxidase c genes was conducted on 18 individual specimens representing these four species and six outgroup taxa. Phylogenetic analyses of these data support the monophyly of the superconglutinate-producing mussels, and indicates a strong geographical component to the data. The zoogeographic patterns of the four taxa included in the study are congruent with those seen in freshwater vertebrates, and are consistent with a vicariant pattern resulting from fluctuations in sea level during the Pleistocene. Despite the strong geographical structuring of the data, only one species, Lampsilis subangulata, was recovered as monophyletic. The authors attribute the lack of support for the monophyly of the remaining species to insufficient sequence variation and the recent origin of the ancestor of these taxa. Based on these data, any future captive breeding projects aimed at augmenting or re-establishing populations should do so only from the appropriate source populations so as to maintain the genetic integrity of these nascent species.
