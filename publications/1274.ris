N2 - Details of the phylogenetic relationships among tetrahymenine ciliates remain unresolved despite a rich history of investigation with nuclear gene sequences and other characters. We examined all available species of Tetrahymena and three other tetrahymenine ciliates, and inferred their phylogenetic relationships using nearly complete mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences. The inferred phylogenies showed the genus Tetrahymena to be monophyletic. The three "classical" morphology-and-ecology-based groupings are paraphyletic. The SSUrRNA phylogeny confirmed the previously established australis and borealis groupings, and nine ribosets. However, these nine ribosets were not well supported. Using cox1 gene, the deduced phylogenies based on this gene revealed 12 well supported groupings, called coxisets, which mostly corresponded to the nine ribosets. This study demonstrated the utility of cox1 for resolving the recent phylogeny of Tetrahymena, whereas the SSU rRNA gene provided resolution of deeper phylogenetic relationships within the genus.
