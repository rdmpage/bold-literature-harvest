N2 - Description and DNA barcoding of a new Sillago species, Sillago sinica (Perciformes:
Sillaginidae), from coastal waters of China. Zoological Studies 50(2): 254-263. A new species of the genus
Sillago, Chinese sillago, Sillago sinica sp. nov., was described using morphological methods and phylogenetic
analysis of DNA barcoding of 53 specimens collected from the East China Sea (Wenzhou), Yellow Sea
(Qingdao), and Bohai Sea (Dongying, China). Results of the morphological analysis (such as vertebrate counts,
otoliths, etc.) showed that significant differentiation existed between S. sinica sp. nov. and 5 other Sillago spp.
The mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was used as a DNA barcode to clarify the
systematics of the genus Sillago. Results of the phylogenetic analysis showed that S. sinica sp. nov. formed a
monophyletic group as a distinct phylogenetic species. It was also suggested that the COI gene is an effective
molecular marker for identifying Sillago species.
