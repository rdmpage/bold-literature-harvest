N2 - In the past 15 years, subconjunctival onchocercosis has been reported from 63 dogs in south-western United States (Arizona, California, Utah) and Southern and Central Europe (Germany, Greece, Hungary, Portugal, Switzerland). To reveal the taxonomic status of the parasite responsible for these infections, fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) genes of three European strains of canine Onchocerca sp. and the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene of their Wolbachia endosymbionts were sequenced and compared to the homologous sequences of other spirurid nematodes. The evolutionary divergence between COI and ND5 gene sequences of Greek, Hungarian and Portuguese strains of canine Onchocerca sp. were similar in magnitude to that seen within Thelazia callipaeda or Onchocerca lienalis. The evolutionary divergence between the sequences of canine Onchocerca sp. and other Onchocerca spp. including O. lienalis were similar or higher in magnitude to that seen between other Onchocerca spp. The results of the current and earlier phylogenetic analyses indicate that canine Onchocerca sp. separated from other Onchocerca spp. early in the evolution. Based on the similar clinical pictures, the identical morphology of nematodes and the sequence analyses of COI and ND5 genes of the worms and 16S rRNA gene of their wolbachiae, the Onchocerca worms isolated from European dogs appear to belong to the same species. The results support the earlier biological and morphological arguments that a distinct species, most likely O. lupi originally described from the subconjunctival tissues of a Caucasian wolf is responsible for canine ocular onchocercosis in Europe.
