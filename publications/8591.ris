N2 - A genome-wide deletion library is a powerful tool for probing gene functions and one has recently become available for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we use deep sequencing to accurately characterize the barcode sequences in the deletion library, thus enabling the quantitative measurement of the fitness of fission yeast deletion strains by barcode sequencing.
