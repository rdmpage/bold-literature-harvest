N2 - Over the past decade, the DNA barcode research community has begun to address the great uncertainties in biodiversity science. It has also shown its capacity to lead a major research enterprise; the International Barcode of Life (iBOL) project will achieve its primary goal of assembling a DNA barcode reference library for 500 000 species by late 2015. This work has confirmed the power of DNA-assisted taxonomy, and it has helped to clarify and address the challenges in developing a DNA-based identification system for all eukaryotes. The 1 500 000 barcodes now available for 75 000 species of Canadian organisms provide a rather clear preview of the task ahead. By exposing massive numbers of undescribed taxa, the work in Canada has reinforced the need to automate taxonomic placements by coupling DNA barcodes with expert systems. As we look to the future, iBOL should be viewed as the foundational element for a mega-science project that will deliver a comprehensive understanding of global biodiversity by 2040. The next four years can be used to identify and resolve the diverse barriers to activation of a $2B Planetary Biodiversity Project (PBP). The PBP should focus on terrestrial and freshwater species, as they are most at risk, but serious studies should also probe the oceans. It will resolve the longstanding uncertainty surrounding the number of species on our planet in a taxonomic heartbeat. Among its many byproducts, the PBP will reveal species ages, their distributions, and the factors modulating their diversification. However, these advances are only the first step in addressing the big challenge for our disciplineâ€”developing the capacity to track the dynamics of all species with precision.
