N2 - North Pacific flatfishes are gaining increased popularity on the German market. Isoelectric focusing of sarcoplasmic proteins and PCR-based DNA analysis were applied to identify fillets of nine Alaskan Flatfish species: Artheresthes stomias (Arrow-tooth flounder), Limanda aspera (Yellowfin sole), Isopsetta isolepis (Butter sole), Lepidopsetta bilineata (Southern rock sole), Lepidopsetta polyxystra (Northern rock sole), Hippoglossus stenolepis (Pacific halibut), Hippoglossoides elassodon (Flathead sole), Platichthys stellatus (Starry flounder), and Glyptocephalus zachirus (Rex sole). Characteristic protein patterns were obtained for raw fillets of several species. Reactivity of flatfish DNA against five pairs of primers was tested, amplifying segments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase subunit I, 16S rRNA gene, as well as the nuclear parvalbumin gene. Amplicons of the cytochrome b gene were sequenced and used for single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. The survey of deep-frozen commercial yellowfin sole fillets resulted in the detection of 17% of the fillets being mislabelled; Northern rock sole, butter sole and flathead sole had been used as substitutes.
