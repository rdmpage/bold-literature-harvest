N2 - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are regarded as annoying biting pests and vectors of
disease-causing agents to humans and other vertebrates worldwide. Factors that affect
their distribution and host choice are not well understood. Here, we assessed the
species abundance, community composition, and feeding patterns of mosquitoes in
an urban-to-wild habitat gradient in northern Spain. Adult mosquitoes from four habitats
(urban, periurban, rural, and wild) were collected by aspiration from mid-July to mid-
September, 2019. Thirteen species were represented among the 268 specimens (132
females and 136 males) trapped, including six new records reported for the first time in
the region. Culex pipiens was the most abundant species in all habitats except in the
wild, where Culex territans was dominant. The highest mosquito diversity was recorded
in the wild habitat [species richness (S) = 10 and Shannon/Margalef-Diversity Indices
(H’/MI = 1.51/1.36)] and the lowest in the urban habitat (S = 3; H’/MI = 0.24/0.41).
Blood-engorged specimens (n = 65) represented 49.2% of the total female collections.
Eighty percent of the blood-meals (n = 52) were successfully identified based on
cytochrome c oxidase I subunit (COI) DNA barcoding. Nine species of birds were
identified in blood meals from the three ecological forms of Cx. pipiens (n = 48), Culiseta
fumipennis (n = 3), and Culiseta morsitans (n = 1) collected along the four sampling
habitats. Four dominant bird species were recorded in Cx. pipiens, i.e., Parus major
(35.4%), Turdus merula (18.7%), Pica pica (18.7%), and Passer domesticus (10.4%).
Despite the availability of dog and human hosts in the sampling sites located in the
urban habitat, Cx. pipiens seemed to have a preference to feed on birds. Culiseta
fumipennis blood-meal host records are reported for first time in Europe. These findings
on mosquito blood-feeding preferences and habitat community changes will help to
better understand vector-host associations and pathogen transmission paths.
