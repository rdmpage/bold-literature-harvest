N2 - Mitochondrial and nuclear DNAs contribute to encode the whole mitochondrial protein complement. The two genomes possess highly divergent features and properties, but the forces influencing their evolution, even if different, require strong coordination. The gene content of mitochondrial genome in all Metazoa is in a frozen state with only few exceptions and thus mitochondrial genome plasticity especially concerns some molecular features, i.e. base composition, codon usage, evolutionary rates. In contrast the high plasticity of nuclear genomes is particularly evident at the macroscopic level, since its redundancy represents the main feature able to introduce genetic material for evolutionary innovations. In this context, genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) represent a classical example of the different evolutionary behaviour of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. The simple DNA sequence of Cytochrome c oxidase I (encoded by the mitochondrial genome) seems to be able to distinguish intra- and inter-species relations between organisms (DNA Barcode). Some OXPHOS subunits (cytochrome c, subunit c of ATP synthase and MLRQ) are encoded by several nuclear duplicated genes which still represent the trace of an ancient segmental/genome duplication event at the origin of vertebrates.
