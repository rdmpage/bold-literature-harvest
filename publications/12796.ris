N2 - Present communication reports the phylogenetic relationship between three groups of a
marine limpet having different color banding patterns using COI sequencing. Samples were
sequenced for mtDNA COI gene using universal primer. Comparative BLAST revealed that all
three types were around 99.59% identical with Cellana karachiensis, first record of this species
from Indian coasts. Apart from the morphological variations, the mtDNA COI gene analysis
revealed around 1% nucleotide variations between these three types. The observed
dissimilarity in COI sequences was possibly too little to consider these types as three different
species. The derivation of amino acid positions indicated that these types could possibly be a
complex of three cryptic species of C. karachiensis. The study proposes that the Oman and
Indian populations of C. karachiensis might have derived by allopatric speciation due to
geographical isolation. The group of these three cryptic species, sharing same habitat between
themselves, possibly showed sympatric speciation.
