N2 - ]The weevil genus Paocryptorrhinus Voss, 1965 is revised. The nominal taxon Anchonidium hustachei Hoffmann, 1965 is transferred to Paocryptorrhinus as P. hustachei (Hoffmann, 1965) comb. n. The nominal taxa Anchonidium hustachei Hoffmann, 1965 and Paocryptorrhinus obsitus Voss, 1965 are considered conspecific and the name A. hustachei  offmann, 1965 is a senior subjective synonym of P. obsitus Voss, 1965 syn. n. The genus, previously known for a single species from the wet forests on geologically young volcanic mountains in northeastern Tanzania, is reported from two other forest types: the old crystalline East Arc Mountains and the lowland forest. Four new species, all  rom Tanzania, are described: P. atropos sp. n. (North and South Pare), P. clotho sp. n. (West Usambara), P. hanangensis sp. n. (Mt. Hanang) and P. lachesis sp. n. (Kimboza forest). A single specimen of an unnamed species is reported from East Usambara. The mtDNA barcoding sequences are analysed phylogeographically. Even though the genus was not recovered as a monophyletic clade in two of the molecular phylogenetic analyses, it is nevertheless hypothesized as being monophyletic based on numerous similarities in adult morphology, biology and based on the geographical proximity of all records. The uncertain phylogenetic position of Paocryptorrhinus is briefly discussed and the genus is transferred from Brachycerinae: Erirhinini to Molytinae incertae sedis.
