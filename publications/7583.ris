N2 - Larvae of species in the caddisfl y genus Diplectrona (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) are morphologically
variable and found in a variety of diff erent lotic habitats across eastern N. America. DNA sequencing of a
658-base pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I gene revealed 7 haplotype
groups within the genus Diplectrona : Four with larvae similar to Diplectrona modesta Banks, two with
larvae similar to D. metaqui Ross, and one that is a putative match to D. marianae Reeves. " ese results
provide initial evidence supporting the need for a revision of the genus Diplectrona in N. America, and
also possibly for the existence of cryptic diversity within currently recognized Diplectrona species. We
discuss these results within the context of the intersection of bioassessment, molecular and morphological
taxonomy, and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.
