N2 - Background The COI mitochondrial gene has been chosen as the “DNA barcode in animals” and the large quantity of
genetic information in public databanks gives solid support for the use of DNA barcoding as a promising tool for the development of a specific molecular detection system.
Methods and results The present study aimed to develop a Specific Molecular Detection System (SMDS: FishDNAIDs)
(primers and probe sets) for the following four target species: Prochilodus nigricans, Potamorhina altamazonica, Psectrogaster rutiloides and Triportheus angulatus, in qPCR assays. In silico and in vitro tests (using gDNA) were performed to
test these sets. The database generated contained the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) nucleotide sequence for 183
specimens of Characiformes, distributed in 34 species representing eight families. In silico, primers designed for the target
species amplified different species from the same genus, except for P. rutiloides, which amplified only the target species. In
the in vitro test, using the SYBRGreentm and TaqMan® fluorescence systems, both sets detected the respective target species
(P. nigricans, P. altamazonica, P. rutiloides and T. angulatus). In the qPCR assays using SYBRGreentm, species considered
to be related were also detected, in addition to the target species, with the exception of P. amazonica and P. essequibensis
(correlated to P. rutiloides). All target species were detected in the qPCR assays using the TaqMan® system; however, with
the SMDS PALT, the target species P. altamazonica was detected with low CT values (22.21±0.17) as well as the correlates
of P. latior and P. pristigaster, though with high CT values (23.51±0.19 and 30.21±0.95). This assay uniquely identifies
known adult tissue samples from all four species.
Conclusions The primers and probe sets developed can act as powerful tools for detecting the target Characiformes species.
