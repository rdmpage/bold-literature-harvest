N2 - Allium is a very diverse genus with over 600 species distributed worldwide. Haplotype analyses of 45S rRNA ITS, trnH-psbA spacer, and matK gene sequences in 9 Allium species were carried out, subsequent to which phylogenetic relations of the nine species were also analyzed. Of the three genes, the nuclear 45S rRNA ITS sequences showed the highest variation with one haplotype in each species. The other two chloroplast genes revealed that more than one haplotype was present in each species, and each haplotype was present in several of the species. In the matK gene, EcoRI restriction revealed heteroplasmy in which the functional gene retains the EcoRI recognition site while the nonfunctional, pseudogene does not. Phylogenetic patterns were not consistent among the haplotypes of the 45 rRNA ITS, trnH-psbA spacer, and matK genic regions. This phylogenetic incongruency might be due to the presence of multiple haplotypes in each of the chloroplast genes. However, the inconsistency of the phylogenetic relationships, based on the 45S rRNA ITS sequences makes a strong case for further analysis.
