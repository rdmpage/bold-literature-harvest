N2 - The Stichopodidae comprise a diverse assemblage of holothuroids most of which occur in the Indo-Pacific. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial gene (COI, 16S rRNA) sequence for 111 individuals (7 genera, 17 species) clarified taxonomic uncertainties, species relationships, biogeography and evolution of the family. A monophyly of the genus Stichopus was supported with the exception of Stichopus ellipes. Molecular analyses confirmed genus level taxonomy based on morphology. Most specimens harvested as S. horrens fell in the S. monotuberculatus clade, a morphologically variable assemblage with others from the S. naso clade. Taxonomic clarification of species fished as S. horrens will assist conservation measures. Evolutionary rates based on comparison of sequence from trans-ithmian Isostichopus species estimated that Stichopus and Isostichopus diverged ca. 5.5-10.7Ma (Miocene). More recent splits were estimated to be younger than 1Ma.
