N2 - In this study, we analyzed the nuclear ITS2 rRNA primary sequence and secondary structure in Veneridae and comparatively with 20 Bivalvia taxa to test the phylogenetic resolution of this marker and its suitability for molecular diagnosis at different taxonomic levels.
Maximum likelihood and Bayesian trees based on primary sequences were congruent with (proﬁle-) neighbor-joining trees based on a combined model of sequence-structure evolution. ITS2 showed higher
resolution below the subfamily level, providing a phylogenetic signal comparable to (mitochondrial/nuclear) gene fragments 2–5 times longer. Structural elements of the ITS2 folding, such as speciﬁc mismatch pairing and compensatory base changes, provided further support for the monophyly of some groups and for their phylogenetic relationships. Veneridae ITS2 folding is structured in six domains (DI–VI) and shows ﬁve striking sequence-structure features. Two of them, the Basal and Apical STEMs, are common to Bivalvia, while the presence of both the Branched STEM and the Y/R stretches occurs in ﬁve superfamilies of the two Heterodonta orders Myoida and Veneroida, thus questioning their reciprocal monophyly. Our results validated the ITS2 as a suitable marker for venerids phylogenetics and taxonomy, and underlined the signiﬁcance of including secondary structure information for both applications at several systematic levels within bivalves.
