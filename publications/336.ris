N2 - Previous analyses have demonstrated that, among the echinoderms, the sea star (class: Asteroidea) mitochondrial genome contains a large inversion in comparison to the mitochondrial DNA of sea urchins (class: Echinoidea). Polymerase chain reaction amplification, DNA cloning, and sequencing have been used to examine the relationships of the brittle stars (class: Ophiuroidea) and sea cucumbers (class: Holothuroidea) to the sea stars and sea urchins. The DNA sequence of the regions spanning potential inversion junctions in both brittle stars and sea cucumbers has been determined. This study has also revealed a highly modified tRNA cluster in the ophiuroid mitochondrial genome. Our data indicate mitochondrial gene arrangement patterns that group the sea cucumbers with sea urchins and sea stars with brittle stars. This use of molecular characters clarifies the relationships among these classes.
