N2 - The complete nucleotide sequence (21,359 bp) of the mitochondrial DNA of the rhacophorid frog Rhacophorus schlegelii was determined. The gene content, nucleotide composition, and codon usage of this genome corresponded to those typical of vertebrates. However, the Rh. schlegelii genome was unusually large due to the inclusion of two control regions and the accumulation of lengthy repetitive sequences in these regions. The two control regions had 97% sequence similarity over 1,510 bp, suggesting the occurrence of concerted sequence evolution. Comparison of the gene organizations among anuran species revealed that the mitochondrial gene arrangement of Rh. schlegelii diverged from that of typical vertebrates but was similar to that of Buergeria buergeri. The positions of the tRNA-Leu(CUN) and tRNA-Thr genes were exchanged between Rh. schlegelii and B. buergeri. Based on parsimonious consideration and the basal phylogenetic position of B. buergeri, these genes seemed to have been rearranged in an ancestral lineage leading to Rh. schlegelii.
