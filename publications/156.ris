N2 - The complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial (mt) genomes of three cephalopods, Octopus vulgaris (Octopodiformes, Octopoda, Incirrata), Todarodes pacificus (Decapodiformes, Oegopsida, Ommastrephidae), and Watasenia scintillans (Decapodiformes, Oegopsida, Enoploteuthidae), were determined. These three mt genomes encode the standard set of metazoan mt genes. However, W. scintillans and T. pacificus mt genomes share duplications of the longest noncoding region, three cytochrome oxidase subunit genes and two ATP synthase subunit genes, and the tRNA(Asp) gene. Southern hybridization analysis of the W. scintillans mt genome shows that this single genome carries both duplicated regions. The near-identical sequence of the duplicates suggests that there are certain concerted evolutionary mechanisms, at least in cephalopod mitochondria. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of mt protein genes are suggestive, although not statistically significantly so, of a monophyletic relationship between W. scintillans and T. pacificus.
