N2 - The Beas River is one of the important rivers of the Indus River system located in Himachal Pradesh, India, that harbors a diverse range of freshwater fish species. The present study employed COI gene to investigate the ichthyofaunal diversity of river Beas. Through the sequencing of 203 specimens from Beas River, we identified 43 species, belonging to 31 genera, 16 families, and 10 orders. To analyze the genetic divergence and phylogeny of identified species, 485 sequences of Indian origin were retrieved from BOLD, resulting in a dataset of 688 sequences. Our findings consistently revealed a hierarchical increase in the mean K2P genetic divergence within species (0.80%), genus (9.06%), and families (15.35%). Automated Barcode Gap discovery, Neighbour Joining, and Bayesian inference consensus tree methodologies were employed to determine the putative species and their phylogeny, successfully delimiting most of the species with only a few exceptions. The results unveiled six species exhibiting high intra-species divergence (>â€‰2%), suggesting the presence of sibling species and falsely identified sequences on online databases. The present study established the first DNA barcoding-based inventory of freshwater fish species in the Beas River providing comprehensive insights into economically exploited endangered and vulnerable species. In order to ensure the sustainable use of aquatic resources in the Beas River, we recommend the implementation of species measures to protect biodiversity and genetic resources.
