N2 - Although consensus has now been reached on a general two-locus DNA barcode for land plants, the selected combination
of markers (rbcL + matK) is not applicable for ferns at the moment. Yet especially for ferns, DNA barcoding is potentially of
great value since fern gametophytes—while playing an essential role in fern colonization and reproduction—generally lack
the morphological complexity for morphology-based identification and have therefore been underappreciated in ecological
studies. We evaluated the potential of a combination of rbcL with a noncoding plastid marker, trnL-F, to obtain DNAidentifications
for fern species. A regional approach was adopted, by creating a reference database of trusted rbcL and trnL-F
sequences for the wild-occurring homosporous ferns of NW-Europe. A combination of parsimony analyses and distancebased
analyses was performed to evaluate the discriminatory power of the two-region barcode. DNA was successfully
extracted from 86 tiny fern gametophytes and was used as a test case for the performance of DNA-based identification.
Primer universality proved high for both markers. Based on the combined rbcL + trnL-F dataset, all genera as well as all
species with non-equal chloroplast genomes formed their own well supported monophyletic clade, indicating a high
discriminatory power. Interspecific distances were larger than intraspecific distances for all tested taxa. Identification tests
on gametophytes showed a comparable result. All test samples could be identified to genus level, species identification was
well possible unless they belonged to a pair of Dryopteris species with completely identical chloroplast genomes. Our results
suggest a high potential of the combined use of rbcL and trnL-F as a two-locus cpDNA barcode for identification of fern
species. A regional approach may be preferred for ecological tests. We here offer such a ready-to-use barcoding approach
for ferns, which opens the way for answering a whole range of questions previously unaddressed in fern gametophyte
ecology.
