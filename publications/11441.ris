N2 - To clarify the historical phylogeography of a Japanese earthworm, nucleotide sequence variations of Metaphaire sieboldi were investigated with respect to its geographic distribution. Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), including the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) region and the 16S rDNA region, of 72 samples including 4 outgroup taxa, and phylogenetic analyses using neighbour-joining (NJ) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods indicated that M. sieboldi forms a monophyletic group. This monophyletic group was divided into seven subgroups; most subgroups comprised individuals from several areas, except for southern Shikoku and southern Kyushu. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the Shikoku and Kinki populations were paraphyletic at the basal node, and individuals from Kyushu and western Shikoku were positioned at the advanced group. Estimated phylogeographic events based on mtDNA analyses include (1) M. sieboldi originated in Shikoku and/or Kinki, (2) individuals from Chugoku and Kyushu have a common ancestor from Shikoku, and (3) individuals from western Shikoku originated from Kyushu progenitors (about 0.4–0.5 mya) after separation by rising sea levels.
