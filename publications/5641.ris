N2 - Taxa of conservation interest are frequently identified using morphological or ecological characters. These characters are assumed to represent evolutionary importance, population structure and/or phylogenetic relationships in such organisms. We tested this assumption using two species complexes of the moth genus Hemileuca (Saturniidae). Both have populations threatened by habitat loss and need conservation protection. Legislation protects one taxon with apparent ecological differences. We sequenced 624 base pairs of mtDNA from the COI gene for geographically distant populations of the Hemileuca maia species complex and the H. electra species complex. Resultant phylogenies contradict prior assumptions about relationships in both species complexes. The legislatively protected Bog Buckmoth is paraphyletic with widespread H. maia, and its use of a novel hostplant seems to be a local adaptation. Divergent morphology and hostplant use among H. electra subspecies are associated with modest genetic divergence (0.48%). However, a group of unrecognized populations that are morphologically similar and geographically close to H. electra electra have mtDNA that is divergent by an average of 4.1%. There is disagreement regarding prioritization of ecological divergence over neutral genetic distance in conservation. We place ecological variation in a phylogenetic context and recommend that exploration of genetic relationships be undertaken when populations are threatened. Adaptive ecological variation should be evaluated in a phylogenetic context to understand its conservation importance. This study illustrates the importance both of phylogenetic context and the use of independent characters in assessing biodiversity for conservation prioritization.
