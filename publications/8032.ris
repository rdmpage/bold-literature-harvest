N2 - Graphium butterflies are famous in Peninsular Malaysia for their colourful wings, yet their taxonomy remains unresolved. The popular guides to Malaysian butterflies, place the species in one, two or three genera and identification to species using obscure morphological characters can be difficult, especially for the closely related species, G. bathycles bathycloides and G. chironides malayanum. We sequenced the COI mtDNA barcode for Graphium specimens in the Museum of Zoology, University of Malaya to test the utility of DNA barcoding for the identification of Graphium species. Additionally, we sequenced 28S rRNA to examine, in conjunction with COI, the phylogenetic relationships of these species and investigate the validity of Pathysa and Paranticopsis as distinct genera. We found that all species of Graphium possessed a distinctive cluster of DNA barcodes with the exception of specimens originally identified as G. bathycles bathycloides and G. chironides malayanum which shared DNA barcodes. On further examination we found that the morphological determinations were ambiguous as the specimens overlapped for diagnostic characters reported for each species. The COI and 28S rRNA phylogenetic trees showed a similar topology with Paranticopsis species forming a clade nested within a larger clade also comprising Pathysa species. Based on this topology, in order for Pathysa to be a valid genus, at least three other clades within Graphium s.l. would also have to be raised as genera.
