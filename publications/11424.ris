N2 - DNA barcoding has shown high efficiency in taxonomy disentanglement. However, barcode clusters do not necessarily reflect independent biological species. Herein, Protapes clams in seas of the south China were used as a case study to illustrate how additional lines of evidences confirm the species status of cryptic species uncovered in barcoding studies. Species boundaries within Protapes were delimited iteratively using six gene fragments under both distance-based and phylogeny-based approaches. Our results showed that species candidates within Paphia (Protapes) gallus complex are independent biological species, and two hidden species also exist within P. (P.) sinuosa. Our results double the number of species of Protapes in the western Pacific, suggesting its biodiversity in this region might be severely underestimated. The present study shows that combining DNA barcoding with subsequent multiple-line analyses is effective in species-level biodiversity exploration.
