N2 - To discriminate the cortex herbs of Chinese Pharmacopoeia, the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA of 51 samples belonging to 19 kinds of cortex herbs were analyzed in this paper. Sequence assembly was performed using the CodonCode Aligner. Phylogenetic study was performed using the molecular
evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) 4.0 software in accordance with the Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) model. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighborjoining (NJ) method. We found that the ITS2 sequences of the studied samples ranged from 207 to 256 bp in length and easy to be ampliﬁed. The intraspeciﬁc genetic distance
of the cortex herbs was between 0 and 0.073, which was lower than their interspeciﬁc genetic distance (mean, 0.868; minimum, 0.101). In the cluster dendrogram, all the studied medicinal materials with several samples, were monophyletic. It is concluded that ITS2 barcode is suitable for the identiﬁcation of cortex herbs of Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and it will play an important role in the ﬁeld of identiﬁcation of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
