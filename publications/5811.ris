N2 - The leafmining ßy Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is an important
pest of vegetable and cut-ßower crops. In recent decades, this species has become invasive, spreading
from the Americas to the rest of the world. Despite substantial losses caused by Liriomyza leafminers,
the systematics of these ßies has remained poorly understood because of their small size and
morphological homogeneity. Previous molecular research on other polyphagous Liriomyza pests has
suggested that cryptic species may be present. Here, we use mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I
sequence variation to investigate phylogeographic structure within L. trifolii. Our results indicate that
L. trifolii harbors distinct phylogenetic clades, suggesting the presence of cryptic species. There is also
evidence of a recently derived, highly specialized pepper (Capsicum spp., Solanaceae)-feeding
population within L. trifolii that may represent a host race or even a distinct species. Introduced
populations from various locations contained a highly restricted subset of the mitochondrial variation
present within L. trifolii, suggesting one or more bottlenecks during colonization.
