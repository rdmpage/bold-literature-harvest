N2 - Oxyrrhis marina is an important model in ecological studies of free-living protists. Despite this, O. marina has rarely been studied in the environment and no explicit distributional studies exist. Further, phylogenetic data for a small number of isolates indicate that O. marina constitutes two divergent lineages. Here, we quantify phylogenetic variation between 58 globally distributed O. marina isolates using 5.8S – internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 rDNA (5.8S ITS) and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) partial sequences. 5.8S ITS and COI phylogenies both partitioned O. marina into four clades, which formed two lineages; mean sequence identity for 5.8S ITS and COI respectively was &#8764;40 and 90% between these two lineages. Sequence identities for 5.8S ITS/ COI between clades within lineages were 66.3/99.4% (lineage 1: clade 1 vs 2) and 42.3/99.1% (lineage 2: clade 3 vs 4). rDNA mutation rates in O. marina appear to be abnormally high and were not interpreted in a species delineation context. Based on variation in COI sequence and comparisons with other protists, we suggest that O. marina lineages may constitute two species. In a geographic context, evidence of spatial restriction but also extensive overlap between O. marina clades occurred. Further, clade abundances varied considerably: clades 1 and 2 (belonging to one lineage) were abundant and widespread; in contrast, clades 3 and 4 (belonging to the second lineage) were rare and spatially restricted (occurring only in the Mediterranean or in culture collection). There is need for further phylogenetic and taxonomic studies to assess species delineation in O. marina, and for the application of high resolution genetic markers to resolve processes driving genetic diversity in this important model organism.
