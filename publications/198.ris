N2 - Pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) clones have been shown to be adapted to particular host plant species but it is unknown whether there are host races. A 1101 base pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) was sequenced for 21 pea aphid clones that had been collected from different host plants in Canada and the U.S.A. Only five closely related mitochondrial haplotypes were found. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was estimated for these five haplotypes and four related aphid species: Acyrthosiphon macrosiphum, A. kondoi, Fimbriaphis fimbriata, and Macrosiphum creelii. Pea aphids from the same host plant species were no more likely to have the same mitochondrial haplotype than aphids from different host plant species. In addition, aphids from the same geographical regions were no more likely to have the same mitochondrial haplotype than aphids from different geographic regions. I therefore reject the hypothesis that there are monophyletic host races of the pea aphid.
