N2 - The complete nucleotide sequence of the tapeworm Taenia solium mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been determined. The sequence is 13,709 base pairs in length and contains 36 genes (12 for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, 2 for ribosomal RNAs, and 22 for transfer RNAs). The gene content and organization of the T. solium mtDNA are identical to those of other taeniid mtDNAs. All genes are transcribed in the same direction, and all protein-coding genes appear to initiate with the AUG or GUG codon. In a gene for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, the abbreviated stop codon U was confirmed for the first time in flatworm mtDNAs.
