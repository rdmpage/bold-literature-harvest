N2 - Amplification and sequencing of mitochondrial DNA regions corresponding to three major clusters of transfer RNA genes from a variety of species representing major groups of birds and reptiles revealed some new variations in tRNA gene organization. First, a gene rearrangement from tRNA(His)-tRNA(Ser)(AGY)-tRNA(Leu)(CUN) to tRNA(Ser)(AGY)-tRNA(His)tRNA(Leu)(CUN) occurs in all three crocodilians examined (alligator, caiman, and crocodile). In addition an exceptionally long spacer region between the genes for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 and tRNA(Ser)(AGY) is found in caiman. Second, in congruence with a recent finding by Seutin et al., a characteristic stem-and-loop structure for the putative light-strand replication origin located between tRNA(Asn) and tRNA(Cys) genes is absent for all the birds and crocodilians. This stem-and-loop structure is absent in an additional species, the Texas blind snake, whereas the stem-and-loop structure is present in other snakes, lizards, turtles, mammals, and a frog. The disappearance of the stem-and-loop structure in the blind snake most likely occurred independently of that on the lineage leading to birds and crocodilians. Finally, the blind snake has a novel type of tRNA gene arrangement in which the tRNA(Gln) gene moved from one tRNA cluster to another. Sequence substitution rates for the tRNA genes appeared to be somewhat higher in crocodialians than in birds and mammals. As regards the controversial phylogenetic relationship among the Aves, Crocodilia, and Mammalia, a sister group relationship of birds and crocodilians relative to mammals, as suggested from the common loss of the stem-and-loop structure, was supported with statistical significance by molecular phylogenetic analyses using the tRNA gene sequence data.
