N2 - Cibotium is a genus of tropical tree ferns with a highly debated species count. One species in particular, Cibotium barometz, also known as the golden chicken fern or woolly fern, attracts much attention and is listed in CITES Appendix II. The species is native to China and to the western part of the Malay Peninsula. Traditional Chinese medicine values its anti-inflammatory, anti-rheumatic, tonic, styptic, antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-osteoporotic properties. There are no reports of C. barometz being cultivated in China thus all material is wild-sourced. Due to lack of export regulations, over 500 tons of dry rhizomes of C. barometz were exported from China in 1993 â€“ 1997. In 2001, the annual quota for export from China was limited to 130 tons. High demand and CITES export permit requirements drive frequent mislabeling and false custom declaration attempts. Lack of clear diagnostic traits requires molecular-based tools for identification of dried C. barometz rhizomes. We used partial sequence data in GenBank to screen five regions: rps4 (ribosomal protein S4), atpA (ATP synthase alpha chain), intergeneric spacers trnG-trnR, rps4-trnS, and rbcL-atpB. We designed seven primer pairs targeting species-specific SNPs distinguishing C. barometz from closely related C. cumingii and other congeners. Reference library for these five markers was generated from decades-old herbarium material obtained from the UBC herbarium for eight species of Cibotium. The combination of five DNA markers distinguishes C. barometz from congeneric species, including its sister taxon C. cumingii. The resulting reference library linked to herbarium vouchers is applicable for regulatory purposes.
