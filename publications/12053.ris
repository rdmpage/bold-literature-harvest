N2 - Isoflavones have been associated with several health protective effects. In this work spontaneous legume plants were screened as putative sources of dietary isoflavones. A molecular identification of the collected species was performed throughout DNA barcoding using ITS, rbcL, rpoC1 and matK sequences. The use of a multi-locus barcoding system complemented with basic morphological information allowed the unequivocal identification at the species level of 90% of the samples. The determination of isoflavone content was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. Total average contents in the studied species were significantly different, Ononis natrix and Cytisus scoparius possessing the highest total isoflavones content (396 and 273 mg kg−1, respectively) and Lotus creticus, the lowest (20 mg kg−1). The correlation of total isoflavone content with the phylogeny of this set of plants as determined by the rpoC1 sequences was evaluated for the first time.
