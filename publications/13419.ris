N2 - Peltigera islandica and P. lyngei are rarely reported lichens. Previously, P. islandica
was known from British Columbia, Estonia, and Iceland, and P. lyngei from Amchitka
Island (Alaska), Gough Island (South Atlantic), Iceland, Siberia and Svalbard. Both species
are reported here for the first time from the Canadian Arctic and from the second localities
in North America. Peltigera lyngei is also reported for the first time from Canada. The identities
of these species are confirmed morphologically, chemically, and with molecular data.
Phylogenetic relationships are inferred using the ITS region. The widespread, but scattered,
distribution of both species suggests that they may be underreported throughout their range.
