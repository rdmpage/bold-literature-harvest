N2 - The analysis of variation among 203 nucleotide sequences of Co-1 gene (DNA-barcode) for 45 species, 31 genera and 7 families of the order Perciformes from the Far Eastern seas of Russia has been performed. As a result, 42 species (93.3%) can be unambiguously identified using molecular DNA-barcode at Co-1, whereas more variable markers are required for other species (6.7%): Stichaeus grigorjewi, S. nozawae, and Lumpenus sagitta. The latter includes as well 2 morphologically distinct (by number of vertebrae) but genetically unresolved species, L. sagitta (Sea of Okhotsk) and L. fabricii (Bering Sea). In addition, within this genus morphologically poorly characterized but genetically well-distinguished cryptic species has been detected. Amphi-Pacific distribution is in question relative to L. sagitta. Cryptic diversity was observed in the genus Ammodytes.
