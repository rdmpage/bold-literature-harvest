N2 - With almost 40 000 species, the spiders provide important model systems for studies of sociality, mating
systems, and sexual dimorphism. However, work on this group is regularly constrained by difficulties in species identification. DNA-based identification systems represent a promising approach to resolve this taxonomic impediment, but their efficacy has only been tested in a few groups. In this study, we demonstrate that sequence diversity in a standard segment of the mitochondrial gene coding for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) is highly effective in discriminating spider species. A COI profile containing 168 spider species and 35 other arachnid species correctly assigned 100% of subsequently analyzed specimens to the appropriate species. In addition, we found no overlap between mean nucleotide divergences at the intra- and inter-specific levels. Our results establish the potential of COI as a rapid and accurate identification tool for biodiversity surveys of spiders.
