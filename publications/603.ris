N2 - Black corals comprise a globally distributed shallow- and deep-water taxon whose phylogenetic position within the Anthozoa has been debated. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of the antipatharian Chrysopathes formosa to further evaluate its phylogenetic relationships. The circular mitochondrial genome (18,398 bp) consists of 13 energy pathway protein-coding genes and two ribosomal RNAs, but only two transfer RNA genes (trnM and trnW), as well as a group I intron within the nad5 gene that contains the only copies of nad1 and nad3. No novel genes were found in the antipatharian mitochondrial genome. Gene order and genome content are most similar to those of the sea anemone Metridium senile (subclass Hexacorallia), with differences being the relative location of three contiguous genes (cox2-nad4-nad6) and absence (from the antipatharian) of a group I intron within the cox1 gene. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple protein-coding genes support classifying the Antipatharia within the subclass Hexacorallia and not the subclass Ceriantipatharia; however, the sister-taxon relationships of black corals within Hexacorallia remain inconclusive.
