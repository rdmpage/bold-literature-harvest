N2 - Background: Invasive Alien Species (IAS) cause extreme economic and environmental damage in Canada. Future invasions may happen via diverse pathways and ports of entry, calling for a robust nationwide system for rapid detection and response. Numerous case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for quarantine and environmental detection of invasive organisms in both forensic and bulk samples; however, their scope has been limited. DNA barcoding should be broadly deployed and integrated into a nation-wide biosurveillance effort with a conceptually novel operational framework, supported by several important changes in legislation, policy, and governance. 1. DNAbased identification should be incorporated into Canadian federal legislation, as an accepted standard for validating the taxonomic identity of invasive organisms and the basis of rapid response management, 2. It should be broadly adopted by key relevant federal agencies, such as DFO, CFIA, Transport Canada, Environment Canada, and Parks Canada as part of their operating policies for monitoring and control of the spread of invasive species. 3. The creation of a shared, federally accredited and universally accessible DNA barcode reference dataset based on existing data platforms (such as BOLD or CANADENSYS) should be authorized under the respective articles of Canadian law for the above agencies. 4. Legislative provisions/incentives need to be in place for the submission of raw digital DNA-based information from environmental surveillance activities (e.g., impact assessments) into a centralized data portal, to facilitate monitoring and detection of important invasive species. 5. Efforts should be in place to garner support from provinces, territories, and other jurisdictions in adopting similar legislations and facilitating data sharing/exchange. 6. DNA barcoding should become part of the agenda in trade negotiations between Canada and its key trading partners (e.g., those with signed FTA's), in an effort to harmonize regulatory frameworks at an international level.
