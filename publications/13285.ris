N2 - The revision of the genus Neptis, Richardson (2019), showed that many new species are revealed by barcoding and one of these species, a close relative of Neptis rogersi Eltringham, 1921, is formally described here. The new species from Mt Mabu is Neptis collinsi sp. nov. and is easily distinguished from Neptis rogersi by both the facies and barcode.
