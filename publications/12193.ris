N2 - In 2001, a pair of evolutionary geneticists made the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii a poster child for climate change when they demonstrated for the first time that an animal had evolved in response to global warming. Now the same researchers are applying next-generation DNA sequencing tools to probe further details of this species' evolutionary historyâ€”tools that have become so cheap and widely available that they can be applied to other poorly studied organisms as well. This story and the ones accompanying it are part of a collection this month reflecting on the 10th anniversary of the publication of the human genome, which is gathered here.
