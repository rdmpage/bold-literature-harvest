N2 - We determined the complete 14,667bp mitochondrial DNA sequence of Symphylella sp., the first representative of the Scolopendrellidae (Arthropoda: Myriapoda: Symphyla). With respect to the ancestral arthropod mitochondrial gene order, two protein-coding genes, the rRNAs and 10 of the tRNAs appear to be rearranged. This rearrangement is novel in the arthropods and genes with identical transcriptional polarity are clustered except for trnE, trnN and putative control region (CR), resembling two previously reported diplopod genomes. A duplication/loss (random and non-random)-recombination model was proposed to account for the generation of the gene order in Symphylella sp. All phylogenetic analysis yielded strong support for a clade of Symphyla plus Diplopoda, i.e., Progoneata. However, the phylogenetic position of Myriapoda within Arthropoda remains unclear. The amino acid dataset gives strong support for an affinity to Pancrustacea, while the nucleotide dataset weakly supports Myriapoda grouped with Chelicerata.
