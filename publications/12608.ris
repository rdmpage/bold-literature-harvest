N2 - 1. Accurate identification of species of parasitoid Hymenoptera often requires the analysis of multiple genetic and non-genetic traits. 2. Here, we investigate the potential for nuclear polydnavirus (PDV) gene loci to provide species-level discrimination in the parasitoid wasp genus Hyposoter (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). A region of one PDV gene, Cys-d9.2, was sequenced from nine species of wasps and an additional two PDV genes, Cys-d9.1 and Rep-c18.2, were sequenced from multiple specimens of one species of wasp. 3. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the Cys-d9.2 sequences resulted in accurate identification of species and no intraspecific variation was observed in this gene, Cys-d9.1 or Rep-c18.2. Further statistical analyses showed that Cys-d9.2 has a high prevalence of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions. 4. Our results support the use of Cys-d9.2 as an additional genetic locus for species delimitation in Hyposoter, highlighting the value of PDV gene information to taxonomists studying the ichneumonid subfamily, Campopleginae.
