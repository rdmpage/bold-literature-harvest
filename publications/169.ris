N2 - DNA sequences from a portion of the mitochondrial COI gene were used to clarify phylogenetic relationships among Japanese species in the genus Cercopithifilaria. Sequences were determined from seven Japanese species, five (C. shohoi, C. multicauda, C. minuta, C. tumidicervicata and C. bulboidea) from the serow (Capricornis crispus F. Bovidae) and two (C. longa and C. crassa) from the sika deer (Cervus nippon nippon F. Cervidae). No base substitutions were observed between C. bulboidea and C. longa, suggesting that recent host switching of a lineage of C. bulboidea between bovid and cervid hosts gave rise to C. longa. In phylogenetic trees inferred using a variety of methods, the morphologically ancestral type, C. bulboidea, appeared as a derived species. C. multicauda was found to be basal in the analyses. It seems therefore that C. multicauda is the most primitive out of the seven species.
