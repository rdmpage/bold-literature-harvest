N2 - This study investigated the genetic variability within Cylicocyclus nassatus (Nematoda, Strongylida, Cyathostominae) collected from different domestic and wild hosts (i.e. horse, donkey, Przewalskii horse, tarpan and Turkmen kulan) and localities in Europe and/or USA. The ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene were PCR-amplified and sequences characterized from seventy individual parasitic specimens. While ITS2 displayed 0-0.6% variation rate among all individual adult specimens of C. nassatus examined, 22 different sequence variants (haplotypes) of cox1 were detected. Nucleotide variation was detected at 75 of the total 689 positions (overall 10.8% rate of intraspecific nucletidic difference) in the cox1, with the absence of invariable positions among specimens collected from each equid species or country. Conversely, two haplotypes were detected in horses from USA and in donkeys of Italy and Ukraine, respectively. The absence of haplotypes shared by the equid species suggests an affiliation of C. nassatus populations to their specific host. The results of the present study demonstrated that the characterization of mitochondrial regions may have important implications for studying the genetic structure and biology of equine cyathostomes, and to exploit taxonomic issues and practical implications related to the spread of anthelmintic resistance.
