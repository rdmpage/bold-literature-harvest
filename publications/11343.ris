N2 - The subfamily Horelophopsinae was originally proposed as one of the earliest diverging clades of Hydrophilidae (s.s.), but its phylogenetic placement has never been tested. We describe the larva of Horelophopsis hanseni Satô et Yoshitomi, 2004 of the Horelophopsinae. Larval data are based on larval specimens collected together with adults, and unambiguously associated with them by means of DNA barcoding. We perform an analysis testing the phylogenetic position of H. hanseni based on larval and adult morphological characters. Horelophopsis hanseni is unambiguously placed within the hydrophilid subfamily Hydrophilinae and its close relationships to the genus Agraphydrus Régimbart, 1903 (Hydrophilinae, Acidocerini) is recognized. The results suggest that the subfamily Horelophopsinae is unlikely to be a basal taxon of Hydrophilidae, as originally suggested.
