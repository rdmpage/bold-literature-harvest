N2 - The new weevil genus Morimotodes g. n. is described for two new species: M. ismene sp. n. (Yunnan and Sichuan) and M. polynices sp. n. (Taiwan). Morimotodes ismene sp. n. is designated as the type species of Morimotodes g. n. Species are small (1.6â€“2.1 mm), wingless inhabitants of leaf litter in montane deciduous forests with characteristically globular body and obliterate elytral striae and dorsal sculpture. Analysis of DNA barcodes and external similarity suggest that Morimotodes g. n. is a sister to the West Palaearctic genus Leiosoma Stephens, 1829 with 32 similarly small-bodied and litter-inhabiting species. Dated intraspecific phylogeographic analysis utilizing DNA barcodes of M. ismene sp. n. reveals seven strongly supported geographical clades, four of which are allopatric and three others are parapatric on Mt. Emei in Sichuan. Potentially allied genera belonging to two of the three Molytinini subtribes, Molytina and Plinthina, are illustrated and briefly discussed. Type specimens of five exceptionally poorly known genera (Carbonomassula Heller, 1908, Clarkanthus Alonso-Zarazaga & Lyal, 1999, Gonotrachelus Champion, 1914, Vouauxia Hustache, 1920, Pterotomus Quedenfeldt, 1888) are re-examined and the original labels illustrated.
