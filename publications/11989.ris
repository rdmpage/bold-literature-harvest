N2 - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based insect identification has become a routine and accurate tool in forensic entomology. In the present study, we demonstrate the utility of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene “barcoding region” as a universal marker for molecular identification of forensically important Diptera. We analyzed 111 specimens belonging to 13 species originating from Frankfurt am Main, Germany (Calliphoridae: Calliphora vicina, Calliphora vomitoria, Lucilia ampullacea, Lucilia caesar, Lucilia illustris, Lucilia sericata, Lucilia silvarum, Phormia regina, Protophormia terraenovae; Piophilidae: Parapiophila vulgaris; Muscidae: Hydrotaea dentipes, Hydrotaea ignava, Hydrotaea similis). Intraspecific variation ranged from 0 to 1.17% and interspecific variation occurred between 1.17% and 15.21%. Although differences within species were generally less than among species, divergence percentages overlapped due to low interspecific nucleotide divergence of the recently separated sister species L. caesar and L. illustris. However, all species formed distinct monophyletic clades and thus the cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) barcode has been shown suitable for clear differentiation and identification of forensically relevant Diptera in Germany.
