N2 - The predominantly Western Mediterranean weed Nonea vesicaria (L.) Rchb. can be found in agricultural or other man-made environments. Despite containing some beneficial compounds, extracts from this plant have also been described as detrimental and should be carefully monitored. In this study, the complete chloroplast of N. vesicaria isolate BPTPS250 is described, being the first available plastome from an isolate belonging to the Nonea genus. The chloroplast genome is 151,099 bp in length with a 37.3% GC content. It displays a quadripartite structure that contains a pair of inverted repeat regions (27,012 bp) that separate a large single-copy region (80,041 bp) and a small single-copy region (17,034 bp). A total of 134 genes were predicted, including 89 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed the placement of N. vesicaria under the Boraginaceae family, belonging to the Boraginales order, with a close relationship with Borago officinalis L. This study will contribute to conservation, phylogenetic, and evolutionary studies, as well as DNA barcoding applications for food and feed safety and quality.
