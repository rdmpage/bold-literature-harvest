N2 - The genus Merodon Meigen, 1803 (Syrphidae, Diptera) with more than 50 European
species is primarily distributed in the Mediterranean region, with 34 species occurring
in the Iberian Peninsula. The morphological variation found within some species from
the Iberian Peninsula prompted us to test their taxonomic status by integrating
morphological and molecular data. We generated partial sequences of the
mitochondrial protein-coding gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), the nuclear
internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region, and the D2 region of the nuclear 28S
ribosomal RNA gene. COI and ITS2 sequences were obtained for most included taxa.
The variability of the COI sequences showed great difference between the studied
species groups, exhibiting an interspecific range from 0.29% to 12.5% between
ingroup taxa. Closely related taxa of the aureus complex (e.g. M. quercetorum and M.
legionensis) presented identical COI sequences. The obtained ITS2 sequences showed
low intraspecific variability, only a few taxa presented more than one genotype.
Species status and delimitation was discussed for all taxa in light of morphological
and molecular character information available. Using the obtained sequence data of
COI and 28S we inferred the phylogenetic relationships of the included taxa using
parsimony analysis. Separate analysis of the COI sequences identified four partly
well-supported clades within Merodon, the desuturinus, albifrons, nigritarsis and
aureus groups. Combined analysis of the COI and 28S genes produced a topology
similar to the COI topology.
