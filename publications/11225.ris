N2 - Cuckoo wasps are a morphologically diverse group of Hymenoptera with parasitoid or cleptoparasitic life histories. In the present paper, we explore the phylogenetic signal in fragments of the mitochondrial genes LSU rRNA and COI to resolve the group’s phylogeny. We analyzed sequence data of 33 species representing the taxa Cleptinae, Elampini, Parnopini, and Chrysidini. Most of the currently recognized relationships of major cuckoo wasp lineages are supported by the molecular data. A key difference concerns the phylogenetic position of the Euchroeus (=Brugmoia) group within the tribe Chrysidini. It seems likely that an erroneous interpretation of morphological characters has led to inappropriate rooting of that tribe. We suggest that species of the Euchroeus group be interpreted as forming the stem group of the Chrysidini and that the remaining genera of that tribe be united in a subordinated taxon. Our results imply that the evolution of anal dentition, of significance for breaking into sealed host nests otherwise not accessible to cuckoo wasps, already happened at the base of the Chrysidini and that an even number of anal teeth arose prior to an odd number.
