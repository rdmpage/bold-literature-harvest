N2 - Biodiversity repositories underpin the future of research in the life sciences and biotechnology. However, they represent an extremely heterogeneous assemblage of collections that are lacking a comprehensive index of available resources. A set of “best practices” for biospecimen characterization is proposed for repository biomaterials involving standardized species-level molecular genotyping (DNA barcoding) and the quantification of nuclear DNA content (genome size). This approach has implications for upstream sample collection and preservation methods, as well as downstream implications for highlighting biorepository specimens available for genetic and genomic research. The broad application of the approach here proposed will raise the profile of participating biodiversity repositories, facilitate the compilation of validated reference sequences for molecular species recognition, and drive a deeper understanding of the evolution of the genome.
