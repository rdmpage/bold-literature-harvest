N2 - The aim of the present research is to determine the phylogenetic position of Setaria digitata of Sri Lanka in the evolutionary tree of filarial worms. DNA sequences of portions of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and small subunit ribosomal RNA (12S rDNA) were analysed. Intra-specific variation was observed in CO1 but not in 12S rDNA. Phylogenetic trees inferred from these two genes resembled one another in recognizing monophyly of Setaria. S. digitata and Setaria labiatopapillosa appear to be sister species.
