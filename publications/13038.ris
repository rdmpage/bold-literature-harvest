N2 - Background: In 2015 a rapid, barcode-assisted all taxon biodiversity inventory was completed at the rare Charitable Research Reserve in Cambridge, Canada. Two approaches were used – a 7-month sampling program and a 24 h bioblitz, each employing a variety of collecting techniques. Delegates from the 6th International Barcode of Life Conference took part in the bioblitz, expanding the species inventory through collection and identification of animals, plants, and fungi. During the single week of the conference, 3502 bioblitz specimens were collected, analyzed, and their data released in a published manuscript, demonstrating how swift a barcode-assisted inventory can be. Results: Mass sampling using six standardized collection methods was implemented at rare from April–October 2015. Overall, 5577 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs, a proxy for species) were determined from barcoding nearly 50 000 specimens. In total, 3332 BINs were released with the first publication, and the subsequent two months of collecting resulted in 2245 additional BINs. Insects dominated the inventory with 4554 BINs, mainly Diptera (49%) and Hymenoptera (23%). Adding the BINs that were assigned to species using the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) resulted in a species checklist of 3348 animals, plants, and fungi. Using public data on BOLD, a near complete BIN reference library was created to represent all animal species known from the reserve. Significance: Standardized methods of sampling are easy to implement and gather large and diverse quantities of specimens. Coupling this mass sampling with DNA barcoding can provide a rapid taxon inventory, even in the absence of taxonomic specialists. One season of this approach can result in an impressive local checklist— this study has now made rare one the best-inventoried reserves in North America. Furthermore, this approach complements traditional surveys and provides valuable occurrence data for difficult and smallbodied groups often disregarded.
