N2 - Nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes, or “numts”, are nonfunctional copies of mitochondrial genes that have been translocated to the nuclear genome. Numts have been used to study differences in mutation rates between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, but have also been implicated as troublesome for phylogenetic studies and DNA-based species identification (i.e., DNA barcoding). In this study, a suspected numt discovered during a study of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) diversity in North American birds was targeted and sequenced from tyrant flycatchers (family: Tyrannidae). In total, the numt was found in five taxa representing two genera. Substitution rates were compared between COI and numt sequences. None of the numt sequences harboured stop codons nor frameshift mutations, but phylogenetic analysis revealed they had accumulated more amino acid substitutions than the mitochondrial COI sequences. Mitochondrial COI appeared to be preferentially amplified in most cases, but methods for numt detection are discussed for cases like this where sequences lack obvious features for identification. Because of its persistence across a broad taxonomic lineage, this numt could form a valuable model system for studying evolution in numts. The full size of the numt and its location within the nuclear genome are yet to be determined.
