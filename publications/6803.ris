N2 - The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene of ciliates was first successfully sequenced in species of the genera Tetrahymena and Paramecium (Class Oligohymenophorea). The sequence of the COI gene is extremely divergent from other eukaryotes and includes an insert, which is over 300 nucleotides long. In this study, we designed a primer pair that successfully amplified the COI gene of ciliates from five different classes: Heterotrichea, Spirotrichea, Oligohymenophorea, Nassophorea and Colpodea. These classes represent the diversity of the phylum Ciliophora very well, since they are widely distributed on the ciliate small subunit rRNA tree. The amplified region is approximately 850 nucleotides long and corresponds to the general barcoding region; it also includes the insert region. In this study, 58 new COI sequences from over 38 species in 13 orders are analysed and compared, and distance trees are constructed. While the COI gene shows high divergence within ciliates, the insert region, which is present in all classes, is even more divergent. Genetic distances calculated with and without the insert region remain in the same range at the intraspecific level, but they differ considerably at or above genus level. This suggests that the entire barcoding region is under similar selective constraints and that the evolutionary rate of the ciliate COI is extremely high and shows unequal rate variation. Although many problems still remain regarding standardization of barcoding methods in ciliates, the development of a universal or almost universal primer combination for the Phylum Ciliophora represents important progress. As shown in four examples, the resolution of COI at the intraspecific level is much greater than that of any nuclear genes and shows great potential to (1) identify species based on molecular data if a reliable database exists, and (2) resolve the relationships of closely related ciliate taxa and uncover cryptic species.
