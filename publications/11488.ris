N2 - Liposcelis entomophila infests stored grain and is one of the most important psocid species worldwide. Six geographically isolated strains of L. entomophila from Asia, Europe, and United States of America (USA) were compared based on morphological attributes and by molecular methods. Decisive characters of morphological diagnosis were studied using body size measurements and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Molecular identification of the six strains was performed via identification of DNA sequence similarities and phylogenetic analyses based on a 655-bp fragment from the 5′ end of the standard mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) barcode region. The results showed that both morphological and molecular approaches were able to accurately identify this species. Kimura-2-Parameter (K2P) divergence between geographically isolated strains was on average 1.75% for the COI sequence. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that sequences of L. entomophila strains' COI barcodes formed clusters with tight cohesion that were clearly distinct from those of allied species.
