N2 - A growing body of evidence indicates that in some cases morphology-based species circumscription of
lichenized fungi misrepresents the number of existing species. The cosmopolitan ‘‘rock posy’’ lichen (Rhizoplaca
melanophthalma) species-complex includes a number of morphologically distinct species that are
both geographically and ecologically widespread, providing a model system to evaluate speciation in
lichen-forming ascomycetes. In this study, we assembled multiple lines of evidence from nuclear DNA
sequence data, morphology, and biochemistry for species delimitation in the R. melanophthalma species-
complex. We identify a total of ten candidate species in this study, four of which were previously
recognized as distinct taxa and six previously unrecognized lineages found within what has been thus
far considered a single species. Candidate species are supported using inferences from multiple empirical
operational criteria. Multiple instances of sympatry support the view that these lineages merit recognition
as distinct taxa. Generally, we found little corroboration between morphological and chemical characters,
and previously unidentified lineages were morphologically polymorphic. However, secondary
metabolite data supported one cryptic saxicolous lineage, characterized by orsellinic-derived gyrophoric
and lecanoric acids, which we consider to be taxonomically significant. Our study of the R. melanophthalma
species-complex indicates that the genus Rhizoplaca, as presently circumscribed, is more diverse in
western North American than originally perceived, and we present our analyses as a working example of
species delimitation in morphologically cryptic and recently diverged lichenized fungi.
