N2 - Accurate species delimitation is essential for the study of biodiversity, but morphological approaches often provide a limited ability to connect different life stages, sexes or other phenotypic variants in eriophyoid mites because many species possess two phenotypically distinct forms: protogynes and deutogynes. In this study, we analysed the morphological variation in 26 populations of the eriophyoid mite, Epitrimerus sabinae Xue & Hong, 2005 s.l., from sites across its entire known distribution and revealed three morphotypes (LNS: large, normal palp seta d; MBS: medium, bifurcated palp seta d; SBS: small, bifurcated palp seta d) distinguished by body size and structure of dorsal pedipalp genual seta. Five lines of evidence (morphometrics, DNA-based species delimitation, phylogenetics, haplotype network, mitochondrial genome architecture) indicated that the MBS and SBS groups were very distinct from LNS (E. sabinae s.s.). In fact, the MBS and SBS morphotypes are properly placed in the genus Leipothrix with the MBS lineage representing the protogyne of L. juniperensis, sp. nov., whereas the SBS lineage is its deutogyne. By expanding the approaches used to link protogynes and deutogynes of eriophyoid mites, this study provides a way to accelerate the delineation of species boundaries in this important group of plant pests.
