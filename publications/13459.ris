N2 - Two new skipper butterfly (Hesperiidae) species are described from the United States: Staphylus floridus Grishin, sp. n. (type locality in Florida, Volusia Co.) and Staphylus ecos Grishin, sp. n. (type locality in Texas, Brewster Co.). They are cryptic and hence escaped recognition. They differ from their sister species by the relative size and morphology of genitalia and by genotype—including and beyond the COI barcode—thus suggesting genetic isolation that argues for their species-level status. A lectotype is designated for Helias ascalaphus Staudinger, 1876. Staphylus opites (Godman & Salvin, 1896), stat. rest. is a species-level taxon and not a synonym of Staphylus vincula (Plötz, 1886), while Pholisora iguala Williams & Bell, 1940, syn. n. is a junior subjective synonym of S. vincula.
