N2 - Sixty-one Hawaiian algal specimens corresponding to members of the tribe Amansieae (Amansia and Osmundaria) were compared through DNA sequence analysis. Short DNA barcode-like sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and universal plastid amplicon (UPA) markers were obtained for as many of the specimens as possible, and a subset of specimens was also used for amplification and sequencing of the nuclear small-subunit rRNA (SSU) gene for phylogenetic inference in a broader taxonomic context. Statistical parsimony analysis of the COI and UPA markers for A. glomerata produced relationships among the samples that were largely congruent with each other, although the UPA marker was more conserved. The COI marker yielded three lineages, and nucleotide divergences for these three lineages were intermediate to those typically reported for intraspecific and interspecific comparisons, suggesting that they represent either incipient species or a complex of closely related species. The COI and UPA sequences demonstrated little to no divergence for Osmundaria obtusiloba and the taxon referred to as Amansia fimbrifolia. In contrast, specimens identified as A. daemelii were identical in sequence to lineage 3 sequences of A. glomerata, and it is recommended that this taxon no longer be included in species lists for the Hawaiian flora. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the SSU gene was largely unresolved, indicating that this marker may be of limited utility for this purpose in this group of algae, but a small amount of nucleotide variation was found for samples of A. glomerata.
