N2 - Scolopsis igcarensis Mishra, Biswas, Russell, Satpathy & Selvanayagam, 2013 was described from specimens collected
from coastal waters of southern India and Sri Lanka. A comparison of recently collected specimens from Bangladesh,
initially identified as S. igcarensis, with Scolopsis vosmeri (Bloch, 1792) showed morphological differences between
the two species are minor, and that specimens of S. igcarensis in fact represent juvenile and subadult colour forms of S.
vosmeri. Underwater and aquarium observations, as well as molecular data based on the COI barcode region, support
this conclusion. Accordingly, S. igcarensis is regarded as a junior synonym of S. vosmeri, which is redescribed herein.
Phylogenetic analysis of COI barcodes of Scolopsis specimens produced in this study, together with those available from
GenBank, indicate S. vosmeri is part of a species complex which includes two additional cryptic sister species that require
further taxonomic investigation.
