N2 - Groupers are of considerable economic value; however, their classification and evolutionary relationships have long been hindered by the overwhelming number of species and lack of morphological specializations. Mitochondrial genome is a source of original markers that are potentially useful in the study of phylogeny and population genetics of groupers. We describe a set of 16 new primer pairs that allow PCR amplification of the entire mitochondrial genomes of orange-spotted grouper and Hong Kong grouper. This primer set has been defined for consensus over eight other grouper species, facilitating further studies on the molecular evolution and population genetics of groupers.
