N2 - Using PCR amplification, sequencing and assembling, we obtained the complete mitochondrial genome of Tibetan chicken. The complete mitochondrial genome was 16 783 bp in length. It contained 37 genes (13 protein coding genes, 2 rRNA, 22 tRNA) and a control region. The deduced restriction map revealed a unique pattern of Dra I restriction in Tibetan chicken. Phylogenetic trees based on the D-loop locus and the 13 protein coding genes by Neighbor-joining and Maximum Parsimony analysis indicated that the red junglefowl was the direct ancestor of Tibetan chicken and Tibetan chicken was closest to white leghorn and white plymouth rock, although the evolution of Tibetan chicken appeared to be relatively independent from them. A possible explanation is that the ancestor of Tibetan chicken lived in a relatively isolated environment after entering into the high altitude area and developed unique genetic characters.
