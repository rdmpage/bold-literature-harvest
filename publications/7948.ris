N2 - Unlike most species of Lepidoptera whose DNA barcodes have been examined, closely related taxa in each of three pairs of hesperiids (Polyctor cleta and P. polyctor, Cobalus virbius and C. fidicula, Neoxeniades luda and N. pluviasilva Burns, new species) seem in- distinguishable by their barcodes; but that is when some of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequences are short and sample sizes are small. These skipper butterflies are unquestionably distinct species, as evidenced by genitalic and facies differences and by ecologic segregation, i.e., one species of each pair in dry forest, the other in adjacent rain forest in Area de Conservaci√≥n Guanacaste in northwestern Costa Rica. This national park is the source of the specimens used in this study, all of which were reared. Larval foodplants are of no or problematic value in dis- tinguishing these species. Large samples of individuals whose barcodes are acceptably long reveal slight interspecific differentiation (involving just one to three nucleotides) in all three pairs of skippers. Clearly, the chronic practice of various taxonomists of setting arbitrary levels of dif- ferentiation for delimiting species is unrealistic.
