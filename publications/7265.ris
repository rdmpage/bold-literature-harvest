N2 - Fishery genetics has a history of half a century, applying molecular biological and genetic techniques to answer fisheries-related questions in taxonomy and ecology of fishes and invertebrates. This review aims to provide an overview of the developments in fishery genetics of the last decade, focussing on DNA-based species and stock identification. Microsatellites became the ‘gold standard’ in genetic stock identification, but accumulating sequence information for commercially important species opens the door for genome-wide SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) analysis, which will support or even displace microsatellites in the future. Recent advancements in DNA analytics, such as DNA microarrays and pyrosequencing, are highlighted and their possible applications in fishery genetics are discussed. Emphasis is also given to DNA barcoding, a recently advocated concept using a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene as a standard marker for the identification of animals. DNA barcoding becomes more and more accepted in the scientific community and the international initiative Fish-BOL (Fish Barcoding of Life) aims to barcode all fish species. These novel technologies and concepts will enable a tremendous progress in fishery genetics.
