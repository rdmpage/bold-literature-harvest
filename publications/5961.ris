N2 - The concept and practice of DNA barcoding have been designed as a system to facilitate
species identification and recognition. The primary challenge for barcoding plants has
been to identify a suitable region on which to focus the effort. The slow relative nucleotide
substitution rates of plant mitochondria and the technical issues with the use of nuclear
regions have focused attention on several proposed regions in the plastid genome. One of
the challenges for barcoding is to discriminate closely related or recently evolved species.
The Myristicaceae, or nutmeg family, is an older group within the angiosperms that contains
some recently evolved species providing a challenging test for barcoding plants.
The goal of this study is to determine the relative utility of six coding (Universal Plastid
Amplicon — UPA, rpoB, rpoc1, accD, rbcL, matK) and one noncoding (trnH-psbA) chloroplast
loci for barcoding in the genus Compsoneura using both single region and multiregion
approaches. Five of the regions we tested were predominantly invariant across species
(UPA, rpoB, rpoC1, accD, rbcL). Two of the regions (matK and trnH-psbA) had significant
variation and show promise for barcoding in nutmegs. We demonstrate that a two-gene
approach utilizing a moderately variable region (matK) and a more variable region
(trnH-psbA) provides resolution among all the Compsonuera species we sampled including
the recently evolved C. sprucei and C. mexicana. Our classification analyses based on nonmetric
multidimensional scaling ordination, suggest that the use of two regions results in
a decreased range of intraspecific variation relative to the distribution of interspecific divergence
with 95% of the samples correctly identified in a sequence identification analysis.
