N2 - To control the spread of tick-borne diseases, there is an urgent need to develop a reliable technique that can distinguish different species of ticks. DNA barcoding has been proved to be a powerful tool to identify species of arthropods, but this technique has not yet been developed for identifying ticks. Here, we screened and analyzed 1082 sequences of ticks from BOLD system and GenBank, consisting of 647 16S, 325 COI, and 110 18S. These sequences are reported in previous studies and considered to be correctly identified at the species level. Through the analyses of genetic divergences and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic relationships between the species of ticks, our results show that COI and 16S are reliable in discriminating species of ticks and the 18S could discriminate ticks at the genera level. New universal primers for 16S, 18S, and COI of ticks were designed and a DNA barcoding system for the Ixodida was developed. To assess the performance of this system, 57 specimens of ticks were collected within China. Our results show that DNA barcoding system could correctly identify the species of specimens in adult and subadult stages. This system would assist non-taxonomists to conveniently identify the species of Ixodida based on DNA sequences rather than morphological traits. However, there are still serious deficiencies in the information of 16S and COI of some species of ticks, and additional research is needed to resolve this problem.
