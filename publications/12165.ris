N2 - A new genus, Lehmannodes gen. nov., is described for Aplocera guneyi Riemis, 1992, and the morphological characters of the single included species are compared with those of the (type-) species of probably related Chesiadini genera like Amygdaloptera, Chesias, Chesistege, Lithostege, Odezia, Schistostege, Carsia and true Aplocera. Adults of the discussed species and their male and female genitalia are figured. In addition, the available COI DNA barcoding data of selected species of the tribe Chesiadini and other genera of Palaearctic Larentiinae are studied and compared. Both, morphological and molecular aspects indicate that guneyi in fact deserves a genus of its own which is most closely related to Amygdaloptera (morphological data only), Odezia and Schistostege. The so far known geographic distribution of Lehmannodes guneyi is shown on a map.
