N2 - Background: iBOL has globalized the effort of building an open reference platform for DNA-based identification of living organisms. This has allowed institutions in biodiverse but technologically under-resourced nations to outsource the analytical component of their research to core analytical facilities in countries possessing sufficient technological capacity. The Nagoya Protocol (NP) under the Convention on Biological Diversity sets out new guidelines for international transfer of biological materials that may have a serious impact on the future of this collaboration. Results: It is critical to ensure that ratification or accession to NP does not undermine access of developing countries to genomic tools for assessing biodiversity or hamper the construction of global reference libraries. First, it is vital to draw a clear distinction between basic DNA barcoding analysis and genomic bioprospecting for commercial purposes. This should be formalized by streamlining and standardizing the protocols for exchange of genetic resources across the iBOL network; in particular, the development of a universal Material Transfer Agreement template that would secure Prior Informed Consent from the Provider and include clearly articulated Mutually Agreed Terms of analyses. Such documents should address international practices of genome data sharing (e.g., Fort Lauderdale Principles) and be inclusive of iBOL partner countries that have not ratified or acceded to NP. Next, it is important to alleviate discrepancies between above protocols and changes to national legal frameworks related to NP implementation. Significance: The iBOL community is deeply familiar with real-world challenges of international collaboration in collecting, aggregating, and sharing biodiversity genomics information covered by NP. It should use its unique position to provide a strong and consolidated voice on relevant policy developments at both international and national levels. Building a coordinated network-wide set of protocols for specimen transfer will ensure that national sovereignty over genetic resources is exercised without undermining basic biodiversity research.
