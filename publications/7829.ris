N2 - Forensic entomology is the science, which applies knowledge of insects (and other arthropods) to civil proceedings and criminal trials . Indeed, t he existence of entomological evidences can be of great importance to forensic cases , because they can provide relevant information to delineate the course of the investigation; however, the species - level identification of specimens found on corpse is extremely important. U se of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) as molecular marker for DNA barcoding project suggests that this approach could be very useful in forensic scene, where fast and accurate tools for species identification are essential. Molecular database implementation for insect s’ species is a very important step for the evolution of forensic entomology. Indeed, any country that wishes to have an effective and scientifically well supported forensic entomology service must have a comprehensive knowledge of insects’ diversity. T he main goals of this study are to provide evidence of the COI performance to be used as an effective, reliable and fast tool for a n identification database and to determine what extent Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) and GenBank databases are able , at that time, to identify insects’ species with relevance . T h e COI fragment proposed for DNA barcode was sequenced and nucleotide sequence divergence within and between species and phylogenetic analysis were performed. In the two studies , COI allows observation of species discrimination as strongly supported monophyletic groups and intra and interspecific nucleotide divergences confirm the potential of COI in species delimitation. T he results also showed that GenBank allowed to identify more sequences than BOLD , although the two databases have shown a good ability to identify insects’ species
