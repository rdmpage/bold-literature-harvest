N2 - DNA barcoding is the use of segments of gene sequences to assign individual organisms to species. Thus it can be used to define species and to identify specimens. Barcoding has been applied as an aid to systematics with little controversy in both monogonont and bdelloid rotifers, and also in environmental sequencing projects designed to determine the diversity of microscopic organisms. In contrast, a great deal of controversy has arisen over the creation of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, a major initiative to barcode all the species in several major groups of animals, with the long-range goal of barcoding all species of organisms. This is a very brief review of DNA barcoding, especially as applied to rotifers, and a summary of the results of a workshop held at the 11th International Workshop on Rotifera.
