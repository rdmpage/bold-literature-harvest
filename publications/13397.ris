N2 - Rodents are an important component of South America fauna. Their high diversity
has motivated researchers to continually review their taxonomy, genetic diversity,
species limits, and phylogenetic relationships. Here, we applied DNA-barcodes
for
assessing the taxonomic and genetic diversity in the two major lineages of South
American rodents: caviomorphs and sigmodontines. We analysed 335 COI barcodes
in 34 morphologically determined species from 39 localities along central Andes and
arid lands of Argentina. Neighbour-joining
and maximum likelihood reconstruction
provided clear separation between species. The Barcode Index number and Bayesian
Poisson tree processes were used to confirm concordance between sequence clusters
and species designations by taxonomy. We found deep divergence within the
Phyllotis xanthopygus species complex, with distances up to 13.0% between geographically
separated lineages. Minor divergences (3.30% and 2.52%) were found within
Abrothrix hirta, and Tympanoctomys barrerae, respectively, with differentiation in their
genetic lineages. Also, we documented geographically separated clusters for Akodon
spegazzinii and A. oenos with up to 2.3% divergence, but clustering methods failed
to distinguish them as different species. Sequence results show a clear barcode gap
with a mean intraspecific divergence (0.56%) versus a minimum nearest-neighbour
distance averaging (10.1%). Distances between congeneric species varied from 4.1
to 14%, with the exception of two related forms within Euneomys and the sister species
Akodon spegazzinii and A. oenos. This study constitutes a substantial contribution
to the global barcode reference library. It provides insights into the complex phylogeographic
patterns and speciation scenarios in rodents, while highlighting areas that
require in-depth taxonomic and integrative research.
