N2 - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) at Co-1 gene region was sequenced for 7 scorpion fish species (in
total, 16 sequences of at least 552 bp) from the Far East of Russia and compared with 15 other
sequences of Scorpaeniformes comprising altogether 29 scorpion-like fish sequences and two outgroup
sequences (Cypriniformes). The analysis of the protein-coding Co-1 gene revealed statistically
substantiated bias in the (T + C) : (A +G) content, proving basic findings. The average scores of
p-distances for different scales of the evolutionary history at Co-1 gene revealed a clear pattern
of increased nucleotide diversity at four different levels: (1) intraspecies, (2) intragenus, (3) intrafamily,
and (4) intraorder. The scores of average p-distances for the compared fish groups were: (1) 1.00
± 0.20%, (2) 3.80 ± 0.20%, (3) 12.40 ± 1.20%, and (4) 18.00 ± 0.38%, respectively (mean ± SE). These
data support the concept that speciation in the order Scorpaeniformes, in most cases, follows a
geographic mode through accumulation of numerous small genetic changes over a long period of
time. However, intraspecies diversity was surprisingly high among scorpionfish. Phylogenetic trees
for 29 sequences of scorpionfish and 2 other fishes belonging to ray-finned fishes (Actinopterigii)
were developed using Co-1 gene and four different analytical approaches: Bayesian (BA), maximum
likelihood (ML), neighbour-joining (NJ), and maximum parsimony (MP). The analysis revealed a
monophyletic origin for the representatives of Cottidae, which is the principal scorpionfish family
investigated (100, 96, 98% support level in our BA, MP, and NJ analyses). Similarly, the monophyletic
origin of up to the three compared scorpion-like fish genera was supported by molecular phylogenetic
data. Species identification on individual basis (barcoding tagging) was high. A few taxonomic
complications arose during the analysis and they are discussed here in.
