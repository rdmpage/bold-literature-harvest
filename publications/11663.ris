N2 - Amphibians are threatened globally by the chytridiomycete fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which is still expanding in range. Madagascar, rich in amphibian diversity, remains one of the few places that the fungus has not invaded. Herein, we present results from a pilot survey for Bd in conjunction with a rapid amphibian survey conducted at Ivoloina Park, a forestry station near Toamasina, eastern Madagascar. This park is located on the south-western side of the Ivoloina River in a former lowland rainforest now predominantly covered by plantations of exotic trees. Our amphibian survey confirmed the presence of 12 anuran species identified by both morphology and molecular barcoding and revealed the presence of four candidate species. Real-time polymerase chain reaction screening for the presence of Bd showed that all 59 samples tested negative, thus confirming the absence of the pathogen in this area. Our survey of Ivoloina provides the first species list for a suburban park in Madagascar complemented with chytridiomycosis screening.
