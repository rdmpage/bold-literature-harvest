N2 - Necator americanus is a blood-sucking, intestinal nematode of major human health importance in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The aim of the present study was to compare the complete mitochondrial genome sequence from one N. americanus individual from Togo with another from China, in order to estimate the magnitude of genetic variability for different mitochondrial genes and non-coding regions. For the 12 protein genes, this comparison revealed sequence differences at both the nucleotide (3-7%) and amino acid (1-7%) levels. The most conserved of these was the nad4L gene, whereas the nad1 gene was least conserved at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Nucleotide differences were also detected in 14 of the 22 transfer RNAs (trns) (1-13%), the AT-rich region ( approximately 8%), non-coding regions (8-25%) and in the small (rrnS) and large (rrnL) subunits of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rrn) ( approximately 1%). Comparison of the rrnL sequences among multiple individual worms revealed nine unequivocal nucleotide differences between N. americanus from the two countries. Consistent with previous studies, these findings provide evidence for substantial genetic variation within N. americanus, which may have implications for the transmission and control of hookworm disease.
