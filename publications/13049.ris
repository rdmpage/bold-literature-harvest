N2 - Background: The European Alps are a hotspot for Lepidoptera diversity on this continent. With about 5500 species, this area hosts more than 50% of the European fauna, although it represents just 2% of the land. The “Lepidoptera of the Alps” campaign is assembling a DNA barcodereferencelibraryforthisregionasacontributiontothegoals of the International Barcode of Life Project (iBOL). A regional subproject is testing patterns of intraspeciﬁc barcode divergence in the biogeographical suture zone between the eastern Alps of Austria and Italy. The main ridge of the Alps is suspected to have acted as a major topographic barrier during glacial periods, creating a favourable situation for genetic diversiﬁcation. Results: We present a DNA barcode libraryfor2565Lepidopteraspecies(70families)basedontheanalysis of more than 10 000 specimens. Species differ from their nearest neighbour by an average minimum distance of 6.38%, while mean intraspeciﬁc divergence is only 0.45%. Unequivocal identiﬁcation was determinedfromBarcodeIndexNumbers(BINs)for2442species,representing 95.2% of all species, while barcode-sharing or overlap was found in 84 species. Deep intraspeciﬁc splits (>3%) were detected in 72species,indicatingcrypticdiversity.Inaddition,ninenewspecieswere described.Fiftyofthe1835speciesfromthesouthernpartoftheresearch areawererepresentedbyuniquebarcodeclusterswith>0.5%divergence from their conspeciﬁcs in the North despite their geographical proximity. These cases indicate that the major ridge of the Alps acted as an important phylogeographic barrier during the Pleistocene. Signiﬁcance: Our large DNA barcode library conﬁrms the utility of this method for species identiﬁcation. However, it also revealed a surprisingly high incidence of both cryptic diversity and phylogeographic splits in this wellinvestigated area. Moreover, the results from this study provide important context for several international co-operative projects, particularly on the arctic–alpine fauna.
