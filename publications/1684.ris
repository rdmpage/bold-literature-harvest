N2 - The complete mitochondrial genome of Chinese Bombyx mandarina (ChBm) was determined. The circular genome is 15682 bp long, and contains a typical gene complement, order, and arrangement identical to that of Bombyx mori (B. mori) and Japanese Bombyx mandarina (JaBm) except for two additional tRNA-like structures: tRNA( Ser(TGA))-like and tRN( AIle(TAT))-like. All protein-coding sequences are initiated with a typical ATN codon except for the COI gene, which has a 4-bp TTAG putative initiator codon. Eleven of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) have a complete termination codon (all TAA), but the remaining two genes terminate with incomplete codons. All tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structures of mitochondrial tRNAs, with the exception of tRNA( Ser(TGA))-like, with a four stem-and-loop structure. The length of the A+T-rich region of ChBm is 484 bp, shorter than those of JaBm (747 bp) and B. mori (494-499 bp). Phylogenetic analysis among B. mori, ChBm, JaBm, and Antheraea pernyi (Anpe) showed that B. mori is more closely related to ChBm than JaBm. The earliest divergence time estimate for B. mori-ChBm and B. mori-JaBm is about 1.08+/-0.18-1.41+/-0.24 and 1.53+/-0.20-2.01+/-0.26 Mya, respectively. ChBm and JaBm diverged around 1.11+/-0.16-1.45+/-0.21 Mya.
