N2 - Culicoides biting midges are capable to transmit Oropouche virus, Bluetongue virus and Mansonella spp. This study aimed to assess the utility of DNA barcode as an alternative method in the Culicoides species identification.The study was conducted in Jamari National Forest. Biting midges were collected using HP light traps during four months, February, April, August and October 2018. Insects were morphologically identified to the species level, and rest of the body were subjected to DNA extraction and PCR targeting a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, which were analyzed and deposited in GenBank. A phylogenetic gene tree was reconstructed using RAxML software, and the sequences were assigned at Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit (MOTU) level by species delimitation algorithms. According to morphological approach, 18 species of 2 subgenera and 7 species groups were identified. A total of 191 new COI barcodes from 18 species were generated. Of these, fifteen species have been deposited for the first time in all datasets in the world. These sequences allowed the correct identification of 188 and 187 specimens according to the BM and BCM criteria, respectively. The intraspecific genetic distances ranged from 0 to 16.5%, while the interspecific ones ranged from 2.1 to 27.1%. The nominal species Culicoides glabellus and C. tetrathyris splitted into three and two MOTUs, respectively, except for mPTP, indicating a cryptic diversity in these species. Also, sequences of C. pseudodiabolicus formed two MOTUs using all algorithms, except for PTP and ABGD, suggesting the existence of two potential species. In contrast, some barcodes of C. quasiparaensis and C. paraensis merged into a single MOTU, which can be explained by the complex characteristics of the paraensis group, since these species have similar morphological characters. Here, we provided the first COI barcodes for biting midges in Rondˆonia and Brazil, and demonstrates that these are sufficient to discriminate between some species
