N2 - Although bumblebees have received a lot of attention, some taxonomic problems have persisted for many years. One particularly obdurate case has been the species of the subgenus Subterraneobombus. We revise the bees of this subgenus by integrating evidence from both morphology and, for a 5% subsample, from DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, CO1) barcodes from pinned museum specimens. We apply a reciprocal illumination procedure: (1) taxa recognized previously from morphology are used to stratify samples for DNA subsampling; (2) DNA barcodes from these subsamples are used to recognize groups of phylogenetically related specimens; and (3) for these groups, we re-examine morphological characters in order to recognize and diagnose species. A total of 3854 specimens from 1535 samples from across the geographic range of the subgenus throughout the Holarctic and northern Oriental regions are identified to 11 species. This includes one species newly recognized from Mongolia, Bombus mongolensis Williams sp. nov. Taxon concepts are modified substantially for four species, seven lectotypes are designated, and four new synonyms are recognized. The prevailing usage of Bombus distinguendus is maintained as valid by designating Bombus elegans as a nomen oblitum and designating B. distinguendus as a nomen protectum. Identification keys and colour-pattern diagrams are provided, and geographic distributions, elevational ranges, and phenological activity periods are described to characterize the species. An estimate of the biogeographic history is reconstructed with dispersalâ€“vicariance analysis. In this study, DNA barcode data have been a cost-effective source of additional characters for diagnosing groups of specimens. The barcode data contributed directly to recognizing the one new species, of which females remain difficult to identify from morphology alone.
