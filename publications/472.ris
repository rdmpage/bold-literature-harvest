N2 - Three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the morphologically diverse, species rich, and poorly understood western North American aquatic gastropod genus Pyrgulopsis (Hydrobiidae: Nymphophilinae). Sequences were obtained from 62 of 124 currently recognized species of Pyrgulopsis and representatives of four related genera of North American nymphophilines. Separate and combined analyses of the mtDNA datasets recovered a well supported clade composed of Pyrgulopsis and two other North American nymphophiline genera (Floridobia, Nymphophilus) consistent with the results of a prior study based on a single gene and with anatomical evidence suggesting that these taxa form a monophyletic group. Phylogenetic relationships among lineages of Pyrgulopsis were little resolved in our analyses and provided no obvious basis for splitting this large genus into multiple genera. The little differentiated Mexican genus Nymphophilus was consistently placed within Pyrgulopsis in our trees and is formally synonymized with it herein. Pyrgulopsis was also depicted as paraphyletic with respect to Floridobia in some of our trees while in others the latter was sister to a Nymphophilus + Pyrgulopsis clade. Based on these equivocal results and the morphological and geographical divergence of eastern North American Floridobia relative to Pyrgulopsis, we recommend that the former be maintained as a separate genus. The short, weakly supported branches within Pyrgulopsis and the noncongruence between our molecular phylogenetic hypotheses and geographical groupings of species are attributed to an early rapid diversification of the genus, perhaps triggered by the complex changes in western topography which occurred during the late Tertiary. Our results also indicate that penial morphologies used to define species groups of Pyrgulopsis have been subject to striking convergence throughout the West, suggesting another compelling facet of the radiation of these snails.
