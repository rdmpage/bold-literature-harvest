N2 - Ecological interactions that cross domains of life have
major impacts on ecosystems and human health. Although
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
makes this point with destructive clarity, it is
clear that zoonotic pathogens pose a standing threat
to our species as demonstrated by Ebola, Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS). Other species experience
similar pandemics and are both sources of, and sensitive
to, shared pathogens.
Hence, there is an urgent need to establish a global,
genomic-based biosurveillance platform, a development
which would be of immense value to biosecurity,
biodefense, and the economy. If implemented, this
“pandemic interception system” would hugely advance
our understanding of the natural world.
