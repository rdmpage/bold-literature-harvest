N2 - The Amundsen Sea, Antarctica, is amongst the most rapidly changing environments of the world. Its benthic inhabitants are
barely known and the BIOPEARL 2 project was one of the first to biologically explore this region. Collected during this
expedition, Macrostylis roaldi sp. nov. is described as the first isopod discovered on the Amundsen-Sea shelf. Amongst many
characteristic features, the most obvious characters unique for M. roaldi are the rather short pleotelson and short operculum
as well as the trapezoid shape of the pleotelson in adult males. We used DNA barcodes (COI) and additional mitochondrial
markers (12S, 16S) to reciprocally illuminate morphological results and nucleotide variability. In contrast to many other
deep-sea isopods, this species is common and shows a wide distribution. Its range spreads from Pine Island Bay at inner
shelf right to the shelf break and across 1,000 m bathymetrically. Its gene pool is homogenized across space and depth. This
is indicative for a genetic bottleneck or a recent colonization history. Our results suggest further that migratory or dispersal
capabilities of some species of brooding macrobenthos have been underestimated. This might be relevant for the speciesâ€™
potential to cope with effects of climate change. To determine where this species could have survived the last glacial
period, alternative refuge possibilities are discussed.
