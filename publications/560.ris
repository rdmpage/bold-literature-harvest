N2 - The complete 16 844 bp mitochondrial genome of Neofelis nebulosa has been sequenced and compared with the complete mitochondrial genomes of Felis catus and the Acinonyx jubatus. The base composition of the mitochondrial genome of N. nebulosa is as follows: A, 5343 bp (31.7%); C, 4441 bp (26.4%); G, 2491 bp (14.8%); T, 4569 bp (27.1%). The genome complement and the gene order of this mitochondrial genome was found to be typical of those reported for other mammals. Several unusual features of this genome, however, were found. First, in protein-coding regions, AT bias in the genome was not prevalent in the third position of codons, as it is in most other mammals, but was found in the second position of codons. Second, in tRNA regions, tRNASer (AGY), which lacked the "DHU" arm, could not be folded into the typical cloverleaf-shaped structure. Third, in the control region, no repetitive sequences (RS)-2 were found. However, RS-2 repetitive motifs usually occurr in the control regions of most great cats. In addition, 4 variable sites were found in CSB-3 of the control region. Fourth, AT content in the control region of the mtDNA from the clouded leopard was lower than it is in other regions.
