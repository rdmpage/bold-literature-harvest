N2 - The new labrid fish species, Halichoeres gurrobyi n. sp., is described from specimens collected in Mauritius, in the southwestern Indian Ocean. The new species is part of the yellow-striped initial-phase species complex of Halichoeres, comprising several species found in the Indo-Pacific, including the type species for the genus Halichoeres RÃ¼ppell. Two of the closest relatives of H. gurrobyi also occur in Mauritius, i.e. H. zeylonicus (the southwestern Indian Ocean [SWIO] genovariant) and the rare deep-reef H. pelicieri. The initial-phases of these species are similar and have been confused, but DNA barcoding clearly shows three distinct DNA lineages in the SWIO and helps resolve the diagnostic characters. The terminal-phase (TP) male of the new species is unknown. The new species is 9% divergent in the sequence of the mtDNA-barcode marker COI (minimum interspecific divergence, pairwise; 9.6% K2P distance) from its nearest relative, H. pelicieri. A neighbor-joining tree of COI mtDNA sequences is presented for the species complex.
