N2 - Mitochondrial (mt) genome sequences of insects are receiving renewed attention in molecular phylogentic studies, studies of mt-genome rearrangement, and other unusual molecular phenomena, such as translational frameshifting. At present, the basal neopteran lineages are poorly represented by mt-genome sequences. Complete mt-genome sequences are available in the databases for only the Orthoptera and Blatteria; 9 orders are unrepresented. Here, we present the complete mt-genome sequence of a giant stonefly, Pteronarcys princeps (Plecoptera; Pteronarcyidae). The 16,004 bp genome is typical in its genome content, gene organisation, and nucleotide composition. The genome shows evidence of strand-specific mutational biases, correlated with the time between the initiation of leading and the initiation of lagging strand replication. Comparisons with other insects reveal that this trend is seen in other insect groups, but is not universally consistent among sampled mt-genomes. The A+T region is compared with that of 2 stoneflies in the family Peltoperlidae. Conserved stem-loop structures and sequence blocks are noted between these distantly related families.
