N2 - Crotalaria is a large genus of 702 species with its centre of diversity in tropical Africa and Madagascar and secondary
radiations in other parts of the world. The current infrageneric classification system is based on morphological and morphometric
studies of the African taxa only and is here re-evaluated using a phylogenetic approach. DNA sequences derived from the
nuclear ITS and the plastid matK, psbA-trnH and rbcLa markers were analyzed using parsimony and model-based (Bayesian)
approaches. The resultant molecular phylogeny allowed for a new interpretation of diagnostically important morphological
characters, including specialisations of the calyx, keel, standard petal and style, which are variously convergent in several
unrelated infrageneric groups. Of particular interest is the congruence between the new phylogeny and the distribution of standard
petal callosity types. A sectional classification system for the entire genus is proposed for the first time. The new system
that is formalised here comprises eleven sections: Amphitrichae, Calycinae, Crotalaria, Geniculatae, Glaucae, Grandiflorae,
Hedriocarpae, Incanae, Schizostigma, Borealigeniculatae and Stipulosae. Sectional limits of the Geniculatae, Calycinae and
Crotalaria are modified. The subsections Stipulosae, Glaucae and Incanae are raised to sectional level, while some groups
previously recognized as subsections are abandoned due to non-monophyly (subsections Chrysocalycinae, Hedriocarpae,
Macrostachyae and Tetralobocalyx). Two new sections are recognized, Amphitrichae and Borealigeniculatae.
