N2 - The complete nucleotide sequence (15,719 nucleotides) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the sea urchin Arbacia lixula is presented. The comparison of gene arrangement between different echinoderm orders of the same class provides evidence that the gene organization is conserved within the same echinoderm class. The peculiarities of sea urchin mtDNA features, already described, are confirmed by the A. lixula mtDNA sequence. The comparison of the entire sequences of mtDNA among A. lixula, Paracentrotus lividus, and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus allowed us to detect peculiar features, common to the three sea urchin species, that can represent the molecular signature of the mt genome in the sea urchin group. Analysis of the nucleotide composition indicates that A. lixula mtDNA, in contrast with the mtDNA of other sea urchins, shows a bias in the use of T and tends to avoid the use of C, most evident in the neutral part of the molecule, such as the third codon positions. This observation indicates that the three sea urchin mtDNAs evolve under different mutation pressure. Analysis of the sequence evolution allowed us to confirm the phylogenetic tree. However, the absolute divergence time, calculated on the basis of paleontological estimates, largely diverged from the expected one.
