N2 - Global identification and monitoring programs for invasive species aim to reduce imminent impacts to biodiversity, ecosystem services, agriculture, and human health. This study employs a 658 base pair fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene to identify and categorize clades of the banded grove snail (Cepaea nemoralis (Linnaeus, 1758)) from native (European) and introduced (North American) ranges using a maximum-likelihood phylogeny and haplotype networks. This work corroborates the existence of eight clades within C. nemoralis and further identified three clades that were common to both Europe and North America (A, D, O). Clades A and D were found in eastern Canada, Ontario (Canada), and British Columbia (Canada), whereas clade O was restricted to Ontario, possibly introduced from Poland or central Europe. Haplotype networks suggest clade A was introduced from northern Europe, whereas clade D was introduced from western and central Europe. Networks contained many private haplotypes and a lack of haplotype sharing, suggesting strong genetic structure in this system, possibly resulting from reduced dispersal in this species. This study describes the contemporary distribution of C. nemoralis in Canada and demonstrates the efficacy of DNA barcoding for monitoring the spread of invasive species, warranting its widespread adoption in management policies.
