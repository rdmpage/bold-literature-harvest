N2 - Previous studies on Pleistocene phylogeography of European taxa are biased towards (i) vertebrates, (ii) terrestrial taxa, (iii) single species, and (iv) taxa that survived the Pleistocene in southern refugia. Relatively little is known about whether evolutionary patterns of vertebrate and terrestrial taxa are also applicable to freshwater invertebrates, whether cold-adapted freshwater species could survive in extensive permafrost areas without retreating into refugia, and whether Pleistocene phylogeographical patterns are influenced by phylogeny. Here, the widespread and species-rich European spring snail genus Bythinella Moquin-Tandon, 1856 is utilized in an attempt to mitigate this bias. These strongly cold-adapted freshwater animals mostly occur in springs — highly isolated habitats that are relatively unaffected by anthropogenic influences. Phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses based on mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA sequence data were conducted in 458 specimens from 142 populations occurring throughout Europe. The study provides evidence that most Bythinella spp. survived the Pleistocene in restricted northern glacial refugia that largely correspond to refugia previously recognized for other European biota. However, survival of Bythinella spp. in extensive permafrost areas outside of refugia can likely be rejected. Low dispersal ability and the isolation and fragmentation of spring habitats, as well as the distribution of perennial springs within permafrost regions, may account for this result. Tests involving a total of 29 nominal species showed that phylogenetically closely related Bythinella species did not occupy similar refugia. This lack of phylogenetic concordance could possibly be explained by the stochasticity of survival and dispersal in spring snails.
