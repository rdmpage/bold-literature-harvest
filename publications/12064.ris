N2 - The synergism facilitated by a series of recent developments has conspired to catalyze rapid advancements in the taxonomy and systematics of elasmobranch tapeworms. These developments are: (1) increased interest in global biodiversity; (2) globalization-facilitated communication; (3) enhanced microscopic and digital technologies; (4) availability of web-based taxonomic resources; (5) ease of use and low cost of molecular techniques and (6) the impressive repertoire of available phylogenetic methods. As a consequence, an estimation of global elasmobranch tapeworm diversity is now within our grasp, as is a basic understanding of the effort and resources required to complete the discovery and description of this fauna globally. The generation of robust hypotheses of the phylogenetic relationships for most elasmobranch-parasitizing cestode orders is also well underway. An international community of cestodologists has emerged and through their sharing of knowledge and specimens is making great strides towards expanding knowledge of the cestode fauna of vertebrates worldwide. It is important that these efforts continue to move forward in a collaborative fashion, integrating morphological and molecular data, but also fully engaging elasmobranch taxonomists and systematists. It is equally important that efforts to characterize and describe global biodiversity are not derailed by such seductive, but ultimately unrewarding impracticable initiatives as molecular taxonomy. Integrated taxonomy is certainly not for the feint of heart, but those with the courage to pursue this strategy will be responsible for maintaining and enhancing the biologically relevant context required for effective species recognition well into the future.
