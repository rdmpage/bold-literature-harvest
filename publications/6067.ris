N2 - High diversity in tropical phytophagous insects may be linked to narrow host specificity and host shifts, but tests are complicated by incomplete taxonomy and difficulties in food source identification. Specimens of the highly diverse New World genus Conotrachelus (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) were reared from >17,500 fruits (seeds) at six Central American rain forests. Interception traps were used for comparison with assemblages flying in the forest. Mitochondrial cox1 and the nuclear 28S genes were sequenced for 483 larval and adult specimens. A Yule-Coalescent technique was used to group cox1 sequences into putative species (17 from traps, 48 from rearing). Cox1 sequences of 24 species from museum collections provided matches for three species from traps and no match for the reared species. Inga (Fabaceae) was the predominant host among 15 other genera and 67% of the weevils were monophagous. A three gene tree (cox1, rrnL, 28S) recovered four well-supported clades feeding on Inga confirmed by phylogenetic community analyzes that showed phylogenetic conservation of host plant utilization. This suggests that host shifts are not directly involved in speciation, while the broad taxonomic host range and the evolutionary repeated shifts still contribute to the high species richness in Conotrachelus. The DNA-based approach combining species delimitation and phylogenetic analysis elucidated the evolutionary diversification of this lineage, despite insufficient taxonomic knowledge. Conotrachelus is an example of the diverse tropical groups that require DNA-based taxonomy to study their evolutionary ecology.
