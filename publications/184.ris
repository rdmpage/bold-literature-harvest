N2 - The phylogenetic relationships of leeches were investigated for the first time using molecular data. Twenty-one species were examined representing 7 of the 10 conventionally recognized euhirudinean families. In addition, Acanthobdella peledina, a branchiobdellid, four oligochaetes, and two polychaetes were included. Cladistic analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene yielded one most-parsimonious tree. Contemporary taxonomic groupings of leeches into higher categories were found to be largely consistent with monophyletic groups identified in the analysis. Unusual relationships for which there is some precedent include a sister-group relationship between the piscicolids and Arhynchobdellida, as well as the grouping of the haemopids within Hirudinidae.
