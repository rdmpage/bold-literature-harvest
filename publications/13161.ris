N2 - New data from barcode index numbers (BINs) and 28S rRNA gene sequences confirm a cryptic species pair in Lyrodus
pedicellatus from the eastern Mediterranean and European Atlantic coasts. Therefore, it is paramount to associate the new
species to a scientific name for a reliable reference system of biological information. To this end, we describe Lyrodus
mersinensis sp. nov., another cryptic species in the L. pedicellatus complex, and redescribe the `trueÂ´ L. pedicellatus. Both
the description and redescription are based on molecular diagnostic characters obtained from sequences of the mitochon-
drial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear 28S rRNA genes. The 18S rRNA gene sequences did not yield
diagnostic characters to distinguish these species. A morphological diagnosis of pedicellatus-like Lyrodus species is also
provided.
