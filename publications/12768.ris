N2 - Sixteen species of ants collected from Karnataka, India, were sequenced and barcoded for a 658 bp region of the
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1). This gene is frequently termed as CO1 in barcoding approach
and serves as the core of a global bioidentification marker for insects and other animals. The AT content in DNA of 16 ant
species was estimated as 68.55%, which is in accordance with invertebrates. The variance of AT content among species was
much higher for the 1st base (AT1) compared to the 2nd and 3rd bases, which were nearly invariant. The distance within
species was calculated using Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) and it was 0.166, 0.000 and 0.333% for mean, minimum and
maximum, respectively. Moreover, our data also showed some phylogenetic signal. In a neighbor-joining tree for all
sequences, two clusters were obtained, the first cluster consisted of subfamilies Formicinae and Myrmicinae, while other
clade showed relationship between subfamily Myrmicinae and Ponerinae clustered with subfamily Dolichodrinae, which is
not in contradiction with cladistics analysis of morphological data for ants and is consistent with traditional phylogeny of
ants. The present results thus favour DNA barcoding as a decisive tool in quick and reliable identifications of ants.
