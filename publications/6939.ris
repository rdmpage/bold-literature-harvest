N2 - Vitis vinifera L. is one of the most important crops with more than 8,000 cultivars worldwide
and even biotypes within a cultivar. This estimates is approximate because it is generally accepted
that many cases of synonymy and homonymy within grapevine germplasm exist. The difficulty to
recognize cultivars by ampelographic features has prompted the development of molecular
approaches, traditionally based on microsatellite markers that proved to be very useful to determine
the genetic identity and parentage of cultivars. Recently also DNA barcoding, based on SNPs
detection, has been tested to estimate the genetic diversity within species and to discriminate among
the most common cultivars of table and wine grapes. This technique could be of huge utility for the
correlation of the genetic diversity with the phenotypic variability and hence for the definition of
cultivar-specific haplotypes exploitable for authentication assays. The aim of this research is that of
developing a character-state DNA barcoding to unambiguously distinguish varieties within Vitis
vinifera in order to either safeguard the genetic patrimony of the species, for example protecting the
local varieties and resolving cases of homonymies and synonymies, and to warrant the authenticity
of the grapevine cultivars and their geographical origin.
