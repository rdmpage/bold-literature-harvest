N2 - A new species of the genus Cryptostemma Herrich-Schaeffer, 1835, C. karukeraensis n. sp., was collected in several localities of the island of Basse-Terre (Guadeloupe), by prospecting the particular micro-habitats specific to the Dipsocoridae. Males and females (macropterous) and 5th instar nymphs are described and illustrated, in particular details of the pregenital abdomen, and the highly asymmetric and modified genitalia in the male. Among its American congeners, the new species shows morphological similarities with C. haywardi Wygodzinsky described from Argentina, but differs in male and female genital characters. The standard barcode DNA sequence (COI) is given for this new species, which is the third known dipsocoromorphan representative from Guadeloupe, after Ceratocombus bifenestratus Poppius, 1910 (Ceratocombidae) and Schizoptera elegans Poppius, 1910 (Schizopteridae).
