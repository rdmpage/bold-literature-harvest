N2 - The taxonomy of tardigrades is challenging as these animals demonstrate a limited number of useful morphological char-acters, therefore several species descriptions are supported by only minor differences. For example,  Echiniscus oihonnae  and  Echiniscus multispinosus  are separated exclusively by the absence or presence of dorsal spines at position Bd. Doubts were raised on the validity of these two species, which were often sampled together. Using an integrative approach, based on genetic and morphological investigations, we studied two new Portuguese populations, and compared these with ar-chived collections. We have determined that the two species must be considered synonymous with  Echiniscus oihonnae  the senior synonym. Our study showed generally low genetic distances of  cox1  gene (with a maximum of 4.1%), with specimens displaying both morphologies sharing the same haplotype, and revealed character Bd to be variable. Addition-ally, a more detailed morphological and phylogenetic study based on the 18S gene uncovered a new evolutionary line within the Echiniscidae, which justified the erection of  Diploechiniscus   gen. nov.  The new genus is in a sister group rela-tionship with  Echiniscus  and is, for the moment, composed of a single species.
