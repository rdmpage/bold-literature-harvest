N2 - The sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia pulex has been completed. It is 15333bp with an A+T content of 62.3%, and contains the typical complement of 13 protein-coding, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) and two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Comparison of this sequence with the sequences of the other eight completely sequenced arthropod mtDNAs showed that gene order and orientation are identical to that of Drosophila but different from Artemia due to the rearrangement of two tRNA genes. Nucleotide composition, codon usage, and amino acid composition are very similar in the crustaceans, but divergent from insects and chelicerates which show a much higher bias towards A+T. However, with few exceptions, the mitochondrial proteins of Daphnia are more similar to those of the dipteran insects (Drosophila and Anopheles) than to those of Artemia, at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels, suggesting that Artemia mtDNA is evolving at an accelerated rate. These results also show that sequence evolution and the evolution of nucleotide composition can be decoupled. Analysis of nucleotide substitution patterns in COII showed that there has been an unbiased acceleration of the overall substitution rate in Artemia. In contrast, the accelerated substitution rate in Apis is due partly to extreme A+T mutation pressure. Secondary structures are proposed for the Daphnia tRNAs and rRNAs. The tRNAs are similar to those of other arthropods but tend to have TPsiC arms that are only 4bp long. The rRNA secondary structures are similar to those proposed for insects except for the absence of a small number of helices in Daphnia. Phylogenetic analysis of second codon positions grouped Daphnia with Artemia, as expected, despite the latter's accelerated divergence rate. In contrast, the unusual pattern of mtDNA divergence in Apis led to a topology in which the holometabolous insects (Anopheles, Drosophila, Apis) appeared to be paraphyletic with respect to the hemimetabolous insect, Locusta, due to the early branching of Apis.
