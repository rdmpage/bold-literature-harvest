N2 - DNA barcoding is used to assign a biological specimen to a species. DNA-based procedure has become the preferred forensic tool for criminal prosecution in cases involving the sale of incorrectly identified food. The aim of this work was to develop a DNA-based marker for allowing an accurate and reliable identifi- cation of Amazonian fish species of commercial interest. For this purpose, we extracted DNA from fish directly purchased in local markets and identified de visu by local experts. We PCR amplified the mito- chondrial 12S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) genes. Twenty-nine commercial species accounting for most commercial landings in the River Amazon markets were unambiguously identified based on their DNA for the first time. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed based on the sequences of the two mito- chondrial genes clustered species in concordance with their taxonomic classification. We illustrated the utility of DNA barcoding demonstrating that the group of fish generically sold as ‘‘Acara&#769;” includes seven different species, which are being exploited together as a single species, thus estimation of exploi- tation rates was not possible until now. Application of genetic markers for species authentication in mar- kets and control of commercial landings will contribute to recognition of the real fishing targets and to the conservation of fish resources in the Amazon basin.
