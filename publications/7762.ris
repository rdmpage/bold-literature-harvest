N2 - We obtained full (647 bp) or mini (291 bp) DNA barcodes of 140 mostly African and European specimens of 25 Accipiter (Aves: Accipitridae) species. Kimura two-parameter (K2P) distances were calculated between barcodes to determine the thresholds of intra- and interspecific species boundaries. Thresholds were comparable to or higher than those in previous studies and ranged from 2.8 to 3.0 % (best compromise threshold based on cumulative intra- and interspecific K2P distances) and from 3.9 to 5.3 % (ten times the average intraspecific K2P distance). Identification success was determined using the best match and best close-match criteria and ranged between 84 % (mini barcodes) and 90 % (full barcodes). Incorrectly or ambiguously identified specimens belonged to two species that were represented by single sequences in the database (A. madagascariensis and A. trivirgatus) and three species pairs that shared at least one haplotype: viz. A. nisus and A. rufiventris, A. gularis and A. virgatus, and A. cooperii and A. gundlachi. The other 19 species were unambiguously identified using the full DNA barcodes. The studied species belong to eight traditional superspecies, of which three ([gentilis], [cooperii], and [tachiro]) were well supported. In one superspecies, [badius], species pairs were supported but not the superspecies.
