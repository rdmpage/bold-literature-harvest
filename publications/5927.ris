N2 - A PCR-based DNA macroarray hybridization technique (also called reverse dot blot hybridization) was
developed for cranberry fruit rot (CFR) fungal pathogens, and its detection capability was compared with that of the traditional isolation plating method for CFR isolation and identification from over 2000 field samples. DNA array hybridization results correlated well with detection by isolation when cranberry fruit samples had calyces removed. It also provided detection of CFR fungi not recovered by isolation. When calyces were not removed, the number of cranberry samples where a species was isolated but not detected on the array increased. Isolation without array detection was also correlated with using greater amounts of berry mass for DNA extraction. This was due to the complexity of DNA template mixtures and the presence of some fungal species at very low concentrations. Multiple PCR reactions may be necessary to accurately detect the diversity of fungal pathogens in such situations. Overall, the use of DNA array hybridization for CFR fungi detection is a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective technique that shows great potential for future CFR research.
