N2 - West Africa is often considered one of the least studied regions of the world concerning marine biodiversity.
Knowledge about the philinid snails of the region has largely been based on shells, but shells can be insufficient to
discriminate between species. In this paper, we review the diversity and revise the systematics of the West African
species of Philinidae sensu lato based on a comprehensive literature review and the study of shells, anatomy and
DNA sequence data of novel specimens obtained by the R/V Dr Fridtjof Nansen (2005–2012) between Morocco and
Angola. We use scanning electron microscopy together with a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I molecular phylogeny
and molecular species delimitation methods (ABGD and SDP Geneious Plug In) to define species. Twenty species (19
formally named) were found to occur in the region, including four new species we describe here: Laona nanseni sp.
nov., Philine cerebralis sp. nov., Philine schrammi sp. nov. and Spiniphiline caboverdensis sp. nov. We
identified a complex of four cryptic species under the name P. quadripartita (P. guineensis, P. quadripartita,
Philine schrammi sp. nov., Philine sp.). A biogeographical break is observed around Cape Verde and the Sahelian
upwelling system coinciding with the West African Transition Province; eight species have their northern
geographical limit or are restricted to this Province, while ten species have their southern limit here or just further
north. Only one species seems to span across this biogeographical breaking point (P. scabra), but we speculate that
this might result from taxonomic misidentifications.
