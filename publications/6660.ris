N2 - Recent investigation of one of the larger calcretes in the uppermost reaches of the Carey palaeochannel in the Yilgarn region of Western Australia revealed an unprecedented diversity of copepod crustaceans. Twenty-two different species and subspecies, from six copepod families, represent 70% of the previously recorded copepod &#945;-diversity in the whole region, although the area investigated is less than 3% of its surface. The aims of this study were to explore the diversity of the harpacticoid genus Kinnecaris Jakobi, 1972 using both molecular and morphological methods, establish precise species boundaries, find their accurate area of distribution, reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, and explore colonisation pathways.
