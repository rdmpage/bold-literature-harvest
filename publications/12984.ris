N2 - Remarkably similar forewing patterns, striking sexual dimorphism, and rampant sympatry combine to present a taxonomically and morphologically bewildering complex of five species of Anacrusis tortricid moths in Central America: Anacrusis turrialbae Razowski, Anacrusis piriferana (Zeller), Anacrusis terrimccarthyae, n. sp., Anacrusis nephrodes (Walsingham), and Anacrusis ellensatterleeae, n. sp. Morphology and DNA barcodes (i.e., the mitochondrial gene COI) corroborate the integrity of the five species, all of which have been reared from caterpillars in Area de Conservaci√≥n Guanacaste (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica. These species are polyphagous, with larval foodplants spanning many families of flowering plants. In ACG they occupy different forest types that are correlated with elevation.
