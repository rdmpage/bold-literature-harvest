N2 - The new species Rhipilia coppejansii is described from Guam. This species, which has the external appearance of a Chlorodesmis species, features tenacula upon microscopical examination, a diagnostic character of Rhipilia. This unique morphology, along with the tufA and rbcL data presented herein, set this species apart from others in the respective genera. Phylogenetic analyses show that the taxon is nested within the Rhipiliaceae. We discuss the diversity and possible adaptation of morphological types in the Udoteaceae and Rhipiliaceae.
