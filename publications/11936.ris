N2 - The unambiguous delineation and identification of species remain central problems in systematic and taxonomic studies. Species delineation depends on the data utilized and the species concept applied. In recent years, morphology-based species delineation has been complemented by DNA sequence data, leading to an integrative taxonomy. Such integrative approaches, however, are hampered by the partial incongruence of the various data types with certain species concepts. In this study, we delineated Australian Limnadopsis species employing one mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI) and one nuclear (elongation factor 1α, EF1α) marker and a morphological character apparently part of the specific mate recognition complex, and therefore potentially indicative of reproductive isolation. By integrating the data over various species concepts (e.g. the ‘biological’, ‘Hennigian’, ‘recognition’, ‘phylogenetic’ and ‘evolutionary’ species concepts), the delineation of most species becomes straightforward and unambiguous. Conflicts are particularly interesting as they reveal different aspects of speciation considering the various species concepts. Our study emphasizes the benefits of a truly integrative approach to taxonomy. By combining molecular data with morphological characters indicative of reproductive isolation, it is possible to delineate species integrating not only different data types, but also different underlying species concepts. Overall, 11 Limnadopsis species could be delineated, including all eight currently recognized species, and three so far undescribed species. Most species were congruently delineated under all species concepts. A strict application of the evolutionary species concept, however, would have further split L. parvispinus into two species on the basis of the COI data. In addition, Limnadopsis tatei is consistently split into two sympatrically occurring species under all applied species concepts. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 104, 575–599.
