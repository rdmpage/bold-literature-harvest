N2 - 1 - Introduction of non-indigenous macroalgae has become a major topic in the last decades. Potential vectors are aquaculture, fouling on hulls, ballast water, aquarium trading, fishing nets.
2 - Within a program of census of macroalgal alien species through DNA barcoding we found a population of previously unreported rhodophyte in Cape Peloro Lagoon and nearby marine coasts (north-eastern Sicily, Italy).
3 - All collected individuals were identified as the alien species Hypnea cornuta based on morphological characters confirmed by the analysis of COI-5â€™ sequences.
