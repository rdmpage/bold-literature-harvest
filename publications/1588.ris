N2 - The partial sequences of 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial genes were analyzed for species identification and phylogenetic relationships among the commercially important Indian sciaenids (Otolithes cuvieri, Otolithes ruber, Johnius dussumieri, Johnius elongatus, Johnieops vogleri, Otolithoides biauritus and Protonibea diacanthus). Sequence analysis of both genes revealed that the seven species fell into three distinct groups, which were genetically distant from each other and exhibited identical phylogenetic resolution. Partial sequences of both the genes provided sufficient phylogenetic information to distinguish the seven sciaenids indicating the usefulness of mtDNA-based approach in species identification.
