N2 - The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Liriomyza sativae Blanchard (15,551bp) was determined and analyzed in this study. The circular genome contained 37 genes including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes and an A+T-rich region. The initiation codons of COI and ND1 were 'ATCA' and 'GTG', respectively. ND2 gene used the truncated termination codon 'T'. All the tRNA genes had the typical cloverleaf secondary structures except for tRNA(Ser(AGN)) gene, which was found with the absence of a DHU arm. In addition, a tRNA-like secondary structure (tRNA(Met)) was found in the A+T-rich region. The great difference was that the length of L. sativae A+T-rich region was 597bp shorter than that of Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess). Meanwhile, some minor differences such as 'TATA' block were also observed in L. sativae in contrast to 'TACA' block in L. trifolii. There were also some essential structure elements such as 'TATA' block, 'G(A)(n)T' block, poly-T stretch and stem-and-loop structure in the A+T-rich region of L. sativae mitochondrial genome.
