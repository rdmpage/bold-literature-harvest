N2 - Recognizing the importance of the correct identification of insects associated with deceased bodies for an 
effective estimation of time of death, and taking into account the incidence of flies of the family Calliphoridae in corpses 
and the difficulty of their taxonomic determination, we evaluated the usefulness of COI mitochondrial gene sequences 
as  a  molecular  diagnostic  tool  for  identifying  forensically  important  calliphorids  in  Colombia.  Sequences  obtained 
from samples collected in different regions of Colombia and other sequences taken from Genbank were used. based 
on the genetic distances calculated using the K2P model, nucleotide divergence and neighbour-joining analyses were 
performed. bayesian analyses were also developed and a graphical representation of the variation of the CoI fragments 
for each species. A total 545 pb fragments were obtained; the values of intraspecific distance when all sequenced were 
included, ranged between 0% and 2.904% and the interspecific distance ranged between 0.188% and 18.07%, with an 
overlapping distance, caused mostly by the inclusion of species with only one sequence. When we excluded species 
with a single sequence and L. eximiawas analyzed as two subgroups, a distance gap of 2.292% was obtained, which is 
an optimal value for the validation of this technique. Reciprocal monophyly was observed in most species. We conclude 
that the CoI gene is a good marker for delineating species of the family Calliphoridae in Colombia.
