N2 - Specimens belonging to the Anopheles maculipennis complex were collected as larvae or resting adults from May 2003 to November 2004 in the area of the Athens 2004 Olympic Rowing Centre in Schinias, Attiki, Greece, and identified by morphological and molecular analyses. Of the 201 specimens collected, 199 were found to be Anopheles sacharovi Favre and two were An. maculipennis Meigen s.s. on the basis of similarity to published sequence data for the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) region and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene (COI). Sequence data from a number of specimens were obtained for both genes and compared with corresponding GenBank data derived from diverse geographical areas. A high degree of homology in ITS2 sequences was found in both species, ranging from 99.5% to 100% in An. sacharovi and 99.4% to 100% in An. Maculipennis, with no intraspecific variation in either of the two species in our study. The degree of homology in the COI sequences was 94.8-99.8% in An. sacharovi and 95.0-99.8% in An. maculipennis. The 522-bp fragment produced a rather high degree of intrapopulation polymorphism for An. sacharovi, generating nine different haplotypes, five of which were singletons. Intraspecific variation for these sequences ranged from 0.2% to 1.4%, but was much lower (0.77%) for the two An. maculipennis sequences. These findings represent the first characterization of the An. maculipennis complex in the area of Schinias.
