N2 - Peppermint shrimp resembling Lysmata vittata Stimpson, 1860, a species native to the IndoWest Pacific, were found in the lower Chesapeake Bay and adjacent coastal embayments in
2013, representing the first recorded introduction of this species in the northwestern Atlantic.
Conflicting morphological descriptions, inconsistent morphological terminology, and limited
molecular data (i.e., unresolved taxonomy), as well as the destruction of the type material of
L. vittata, created uncertainty regarding proper identification. We provide the first phylogeny
incorporating individuals from across the presumed native and introduced range of L. vittata.
Morphological and phylogenetic analyses clearly indicate L. vittata represents a species complex
of two widely divergent groups: 1)  “Bruce Type” with a uniramous dorsal antennule that
agrees with A.J. Bruce’s 1990 redescription of L. vittata, and 2) “Rauli Type” with a one-article
accessory branch on the dorsal antennule that agrees most closely with the junior synonym
L. rauli Laubenheimer & Rhyne, 2010. Given the taxonomic ambiguity surrounding L. vittata,
we designate the individual used by A.J. Bruce to redescribe L. vittata and incorporated in our
analyses as a neotype to fix the identity of this species. We therefore identify introduced North
American and New Zealand populations as L. vittata sensu stricto and postulate that the native
range spans temperate/subtropical East Asia. These data suggest that L. rauli is a valid species,
which includes a possible undescribed sister species. We confirm the presence of L. californica
Stimpson, 1866 in New Zealand, the first non-native record for this species. We also provide
data suggesting L. dispar Hayashi, 2007 may be more widespread in the Indo-West Pacific than
currently known and consider L. lipkei Okuno & Fiedler, 2010 to be a likely junior synonym.
