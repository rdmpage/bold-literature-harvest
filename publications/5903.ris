N2 - The Fijian species of Collinias Aczél are revised and include one described
species, C. vitiensis Muir and 3 new species: C. croceus, n. sp., C. dolabratus, n. sp. and
C. schlingeri, n. sp. A key to species is provided and diagnostic characters, including male
and female genitalia, are illustrated. DNA barcoding data are provided for all Fijian species
and several other, mostly undescribed, Collinias species from Australia and New Caledonia.
A phylogeny for the genus is proposed in light of the barcoding data. Pipunculus
imparilis Hardy, formerly unplaced to subgenus within Cephalops, is transferred to
Collinias, n. comb.
