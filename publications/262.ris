N2 - Cumaceans are a diverse order of small, benthic marine crustaceans. Phylogenetic hypotheses for the eight currently recognized cumacean families have not been formally proposed. However, based on external morphological traits and Linnean classification, a few conflicting hypotheses of relatedness have been proposed. Family definitions rely on morphological characters that often overlap and diagnoses are based on a combination of non-unique characters. Morphological analysis does not provide a well-resolved phylogeny. In the present study, we use amino acid sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene to produce a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the families of Cumacea. Phylogenetic analyses at the amino acid level were performed under Bayesian, likelihood, and parsimony methods. Results strongly suggest that families lacking an articulated telson form a monophyletic group. This pleotelson clade, composed of the families Bodotriidae, Leuconidae, and Nannastacidae, is the most derived within the Cumacea. Within this group, the Bodotriidae resolve paraphyletically, with Leuconidae and Nannastacidae embedded within it. Comparison of the molecular phylogeny with that based on morphology suggests that many "diagnostic" characters are homoplasious.
