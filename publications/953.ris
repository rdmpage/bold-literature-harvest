N2 - To understand the systematic status of Larimichthys crocea in the Percoidei, we determined the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence using 454 sequencing-by-synthesis technology. The complete mt genome is 16,466 bp in length including the typical structure of 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, 13 protein-coding genes and the noncoding control region (CR). Further sequencing for the complete CR was performed using the primers Cyt b-F and 12S-R on six L. crocea individuals and two L. polyactis individuals. Interestingly, all seven CR sequences from L. crocea were identical while the three sequences from L. polyactis were distinct (including one from GenBank). Although the conserved blocks such as TAS and CSB-1, -2, and -3 are readily identifiable in the control regions of the two species, the typical central conserved blocks CSB-D, -E, and -F could not be detected, while they are found in Cynoscion acoupa of Sciaenidae and other Percoidei species. Phylogenetic analysis shows that L. crocea is a relatively recently emerged species in Sciaenidae and this family is closely related to family Pomacanthidae within the Percoidei. L. crocea, as the first species of Sciaenidae with complete mitochondrial genome available, will provide important information on the molecular evolution of the group. Moreover, the genus-specific pair of primers designed in this study for amplifying the complete mt control region will be very useful in studies on the population genetics and conservation biology of Larimichthys.
