N2 - Twelve species of Nepticulidae were found on the game farm Asante Sana and on the Camdeboo Mts., all as light collected specimens. Five species are described as new: Stigmella meyi spec. nov., Fomoria oroviale spec. nov., Muhabbetana malcolmi spec. nov., M. asantesana spec. nov. and M. laquei spec. nov. The female of Trifurcula barbertonensis Scoble, 1980 is described for the first time. We record 12 species as new for the Eastern Cape, bringing the total for the province to 21, one of which is also new for the Republic of South Africa: Etainia nigricapitella (Janse, 1948). Primary types have been studied were possible, and are illustrated, including F. oleivora (Vári, 1955), M. stimulata (Meyrick, 1913) and M. maritima (Scoble, 1983), that are closely related to three of the new species. We provide DNA barcodes of all species. Distribution, biology, phylogenetic position and variability are briefly discussed.
