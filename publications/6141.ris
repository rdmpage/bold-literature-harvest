N2 - The Xyleborina ambrosia beetle genus Xylosandrus contains 54 species, several of which are of economic importance. The monophyly of the genus was tested using a data set comprised of multiple gene loci: 28S rDNA; the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI); and the nuclear genes arginine kinase (ArgK), rudimentary (CAD), and Elongation Factor 1alpha (EF-1alpha). The nuclear protein-coding genes CAD and ArgK were used for the first time in phylogenetics of Scolytinae. Analyses were performed using Parsimony and Bayesian optimality criteria. Our analyses included 43 specimens representing 15 Xylosandrus species and 20 species from Amasa, Anisandrus, Cnestus, Euwallacea and Xyleborus, and two species from the outgroup genus Coccotrypes. All analyses recovered a polyphyletic Xylosandrus. Several species of Xylosandrus were consistently placed in clades with the genera Anisandrus and Cnestus with high support values (100% bootstrap support). Among these, was the economically important invasive species X. mutilatus, which was consistently recovered as part of the "Cnestus" clade. In our analyses, both CAD and ArgK demonstrated phylogenetic utility across varying nodal depths. Despite the selection of genes with signals at complementary phylogenetic depths, the data set used herein did not resolve the phylogeny of Xylosandrus and related genera. Since the taxon sample available for molecular work represents only a fraction of Xylosandrus species, a complete revision that combines molecular and morphological data in a total evidence approach is recommended for the genus.
