N2 - Molecular taxonomy is one of the most promising yet challenging fields of biology.Molecular markers such as nuclear and
mitochondrial genes are being used in a variety of studies surveying marine nematode taxa. Sequences from more than 600 species have
been deposited to date in online databases. These barcode sequences are assigned to 150 nominal species from 104 genera. There are
41 species assigned to Enoplea and 109 species to Chromadorea. Morphology-based surveys are greatly limited by processing speed,
while barcoding approaches for nematodes are hampered by difficulties in matching sequence data with morphology-based taxonomy.
DNA barcoding is a promising approach because some genes contain variable regions that are useful to discriminate species boundaries,
discover cryptic species, quantify biodiversity and analyse phylogeny. We advocate a combination of several approaches in studies of
molecular taxonomy, DNA barcoding and conventional taxonomy as a necessary step to enhance the knowledge of biodiversity of
marine nematodes.
