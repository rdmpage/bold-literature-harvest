N2 - Background: With the primary goal of engaging students in current research and fostering their interest in biodiversity and, more broadly, the environment, the School Malaise Trap Program was developed by the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario (BIO) in 2013. Since its inception, over 7000 elementary and secondary school students from nearly 200 schools across Canada have participated in the program, deploying Malaise traps in their schoolyards for a specific 2-week period in either the spring or fall. By barcoding the specimens collected at each school, BIO is contributing a wealth of new records to the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) with the help of these young citizen scientists. Results: Over the course of four offerings of the program, schools have collected close to 200 000 specimens and more than 40 000 were then barcoded at BIO. These specimens represented 4875 BINs, 733 of which were new to BOLD. Only a small proportion of these species were collected in both the spring and fall, demonstrating the importance, in terms of library building, of running the program multiple times a year. Results also suggest that offering the program to schools located in already heavily-sampled areas can still be scientifically (and educationally) valuable, with a school in Guelph, Ontario, collecting 12 species that were new to BOLD in the fall of 2014. Significance: In addition to encouraging environmental stewardship and introducing students of all ages to DNA barcoding, the School Malaise Trap Program has demonstrated its continued utility for library building, with great promise for expansion outside of Canada.
