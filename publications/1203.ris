N2 - The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of the allotetraploid and red crucian carp were determined in this paper. We compared the complete mtDNA sequences between the allotetraploid and its female parent red crucian carp, and between the allotetraploid and its male parent common carp. The results indicated that the complete mtDNA nucleotide identity (99.7%) between the allotetraploid and its female parent red crucian carp was higher than that (89.0%) between the allotetraploid and its male parent common carp. Moreover, the analysis on the start and stop codons, overlaps and spacers, and phylogeny of the mt genomes indicated the genetic relationship between the allotetraploid and its female parent red crucian carp was closer than that between the allotetraploid and its male parent common carp. Our results indicated that the allotetraploid mt genome was strictly maternally inherited. Through maternal inheritance, the mt genome in the F(11) allotetraploid displayed extremely high similarity to that in the female parent red crucian carp after 11 generations (from F(1) to F(11) hybrids). Such results indicated that the F(11) allotetraploid possessed the stable inheritance characteristic. Thus the tetraploid stocks possessed the good base to form a new tetraploid species in the future. Since the establishment of the new tetraploid stocks has the great significance in analyzing evolutionary theory of vertebrate and in improving aquaculture industry, analysis of the mt genome and the elucidation of the variation of the mt genome in the allotetraploid and its parents proved that it was a useful genetic marker to monitor the variations in the progeny of the crosses.
