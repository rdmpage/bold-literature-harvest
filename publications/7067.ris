N2 - DNA sequence data enable not only the inference of phylogenetic relationships but also provide an efficient method for species-level identifications under the terms DNA barcoding or DNA taxonomy. In this study, we have sequenced partial sequences of mitochondrial COI and 16S rRNA genes from 63 specimens of 8 species of Pectinidae to assess whether DNA barcodes can efficiently distinguish these species. Sequences from homologous regions of four other species of this family were gathered from GenBank. Comparisons of within and between species levels of sequence divergence showed that genetic variation between species exceeds variation within species. When using neighbour-joining clustering based on COI and 16S genes, all species fell into reciprocally monophyletic clades with high bootstrap values. These evidenced that these scallop species can be efficiently identified by DNA barcoding. Evolutionary relationships of Pectinidae were also examined using the two mitochondrial genes. The results are almost consistent with Waller’s classification, which was proposed on the basis of shell microstructure and the morphological characteristics of juveniles.
