N2 - Phylogenetic relationships among blowfly (Calliphoridae) species of forensic importance are explored using DNA sequence data from the large sub-unit (lsu, 28S) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, the study includes representatives of a range of calliphorid species commonly encountered in forensic analysis in Britain and Europe. The data presented provide a basis to define molecular markers, including the identification of highly informative intra-sequence regions, which may be of use in the identification of larvae for forensic entomology. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences also provides new insights into the different evolutionary patterns apparent within the family Calliphoridae which, additionally, can provide a measure of the degree of genetic variation likely to be encountered within taxonomic groups of differing forensic utility.
