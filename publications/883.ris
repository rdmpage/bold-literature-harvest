N2 - This study focuses on the phylogenetic relationships among a number of West-Mediterranean cave crickets species belonging to Dolichopoda; primarily a Mediterranean genus, distributed from eastern Pyrenees to Caucasus. In this paper, 11 Dolichopoda species from the French Pyrenees (D. linderi), the island of Corsica (D. bormansi and D. cyrnensis), and northern, central, and southern Italy (D. ligustica, D. schiavazzii, D. aegilion, D. baccettii, D. laetitiae, D. geniculata, D. capreensis, and D. palpata) were studied. Two more species, one from the Caucasus, D. euxina, and one from Greece, D. remyi, were also included in the analyses, together with more distant species within the same family to be used as outgroups. Fifteen hundred base pairs of mitochondrial DNA, corresponding to the small subunit of the ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and to the subunit I of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI), were sequenced in order to clarify the phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of this group of Mediterranean cave crickets. The molecular data are congruent with a phylogeographic pattern; with the geographically close species also the most related ones. Based on mtDNA divergence, the present-day distribution of genetic diversity seems to have been impacted by climatic events due to glacial and interglacial cycles that have characterized the Pleistocene era.
