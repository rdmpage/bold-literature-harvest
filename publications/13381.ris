N2 - In the present study a new species, Sperchon milisai sp. nov. is described from Montenegro and Croatia based on morphological and DNA barcoding data. Surprisingly, morphological evidence revealed that the new species is most similar to S. ampliscutatus Pešić & Smit, 2020, from Kyrgyzstan, confirmed by the phylogenetic analysis based on COI data. The average K2P-distance between DNA-barcode sequences of S. milisai sp. nov. and S. ampliscutatus was estimated at 15.51±1.6%.
