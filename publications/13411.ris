N2 - Phylogenetic  analysis of  transparentgobiesin three  Sumatran lakes, inferred from mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I(COI) gene. Biodiversitas 21:43-48.The transparent gobies fish found in three lakes inSumatraislandis  known as  Rinuak  fish(in  Maninjau Lake and  SingkarakLake,West  Sumatra,  Indonesia)  or  Badar  fish(in  SiaisLake,North Sumatra, Indonesia), and are morphologically very similar to the Gobiopterus brachypterus. The phylogeneticstudy was carried out by analyzing 619 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I(COI) gene in 12 fish individuals from the three lakes. Rinuak and  Badar  fish in  three  populations  have  four  haplotypes. The sequence divergencesin and  between  populations are  very  low(0.0-0.5%).  This  value  indicates  that  Rinuak  and  Badar  fish are  the  same  species  with  low  genetic  diversity.  The  phylogenetic  tree illustrates that this fish belongs to the group of Gobiidae and a sister taxon from G. brachypterus.
