N2 - The complete sequence (14,189 bp) of the mitochondrial DNA of the opisthobranch gastropod Pupa strigosa was determined. The genome contains 13 protein, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes typical of metazoan mtDNA. The Pupa mitochondrial genome is highly compact and shows the following unusual features, like pulmonate land snails: (1) extremely small genome size, (2) absence of lengthy noncoding regions (with the largest intergenic spacer being only 46 nt), (3) size reduction of encoded genes, and (4) many overlapping genes. Several tRNA genes exhibit bizarre secondary structures with reduced T or D stems, and many tRNA genes have unstable acceptor stems that might be corrected by posttranscriptional RNA editing. The Pupa mitochondrial gene arrangement is almost identical to those of pulmonate land snails but is radically divergent from those of the prosobranch gastropod Littorina saxatilis and other molluscs. Our finding that the unique gene arrangement and highly compact genome organization are shared between opisthobranch and pulmonate gastropods strongly suggests their close phylogenetic affinity.
