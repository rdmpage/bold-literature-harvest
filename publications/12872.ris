N2 - Herpetogramma stultalis is a grass moth of Crambidae family. Most of the Lepidopterans are morphologicaly similar and therefore the identification of these insects is tedious using morphotaxonomy. Crambid larvae are typically stem borers in grasses. They are important as pests on rice, sugarcane, bean pods, corn and grapes. Due to its pest strategy the utility of DNA barcoding for species identification of Herpetogramma stultalis from Kerala, India, by using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene have been checked. DNA sequence similarity searches revealed that it is 100% genetically identical to that of Herpetogramma stultalis cytochrome oxidase I gene collected from Australia and China.
