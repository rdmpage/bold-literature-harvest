N2 - The systematic study of Central American moss salamanders has been a challenge to researchers due to their cryptic nature and subsequent difficulty in sampling. In an effort to elucidate relationships among moss salamanders from the Chortís Highlands, we quantified intra- and interspecific variation using data from the mitochondrial genes 16S (the amphibian barcoding gene), cytochrome b (cyt b; widely used in phylogenetic studies of neotropical salamanders), and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI, the universal metazoan barcoding gene). All three loci exhibit a bimodal ‘barcoding gap’ between ranges of intra- and interspecific variation, demonstrating unambiguous species boundaries with respect to the mitochondrial loci. A barcoding approach and Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of the mtDNA dataset revealed that the nominal species N. barbouri represents a species complex, with two of three populations assigned to this taxon being paraphyletic with respect to a sample from the type locality. These data also revealed an undescribed species from eastern Honduras, and confirmed the identity of allopatric populations of N. lignicola and N. limnospectator. Sequence data from cyt b presented an analytical challenge due to a high level of substitution saturation at the third codon position for some samples. Phylogenetic analyses of the entire dataset including and omitting the third position of cyt b resulted in conflicting results with respect to the position of the new species and N. tomamorum. Based on the molecular data, supplemented with data from external morphology and osteology, we formally describe a new species from Sierra de Agalta.
