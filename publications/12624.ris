N2 - The genus Sphenarium (Pyrgomorphidae) is a small group of grasshoppers endemic to México and Guatemala
that are economically and culturally important both as a food source and as agricultural pests.
However, its taxonomy has been largely neglected mainly due to its conserved interspecific external morphology
and the considerable intraspecific variation in colour pattern of some taxa. Here we examined
morphological as well as mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data to assess the species boundaries
and evolutionary history in Sphenarium. Our morphological identification and DNA sequence-based species
delimitation, carried out with three different approaches (DNA barcoding, general mixed Yule-coalescent
model, Bayesian species delimitation), all recovered a higher number of putative species of
Sphenarium than previously recognised. We unambiguously delimit seven species, and between five
and ten additional species depending on the data/method analysed. Phylogenetic relationships within
the genus strongly support two main clades, one exclusively montane, the other coastal. Divergence time
estimates suggest late Miocene to Pliocene ages for the origin and most of the early diversification events
in the genus, which were probably influenced by the formation of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. A series
of Pleistocene events could have led to the current species diversification in both montane and coastal
regions. This study not only reveals an overlooked species richness for the most popular edible insect in
Mexico, but also highlights the influence of the dynamic geological and climatic history of the region in
shaping its current diversity.
