N2 - The complete mitochondrial DNA sequence was determined for the mantid shrimp Harpiosquilla harpax. These data demonstrate that the H. harpax mitochondrial genome is a 15,714 bp circular molecule and encodes the typical 37 metazoan mitochondrial genes (13 protein-coding, 22 tRNA, and two rRNA genes). The gene arrangement of H. harpax is consistent with that of the putative arthropod ancestral gene order as depicted by Limulus polyphemus. H. harpax was employed as an outgroup taxon for a phylogenetic investigation of the Decapoda using sequences from complete mitochondrial genomes. Whilst our results are largely in agreement with current taxonomic treatments, the relationships indicated among the reptantian decapods are novel. Our results provide strong statistical support for a sister-group relationship between the Achelata and the Astacida. These findings not only refute previous phylogenetic hypotheses, but also have serious implications for the interpretation of morphological and developmental evolution in the Decapoda. In addition we also investigated the effects of outgroup selection on the resolution of ingroup relationships. We found outgroup choice to significantly influence tree topology thus reinforcing the importance of appropriate outgroup selection in phylogenetic studies.
