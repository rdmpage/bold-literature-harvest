N2 - We investigated the genetic diversity and phylogenetic placement of the butterflies in the genus Colotis and eight related pierid genera using sequence information from two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes. To establish the status of species, we initially barcoded 632 specimens representative of all genera and most species and subspecies in those genera. A subset was then selected for phylogenetic analysis where additional gene regions were sequenced: 16S rRNA (523 bp), EF-1a (1126 bp) and wg (404 bp). DNA barcode results were largely congruent with the traditional classification of species in the Colotis group, but deep splits or lack of genetic divergence in some cases supported either species-level differentiation or synonymy. Despite using information from four genes, the deeper nodes in our phylogeny were not strongly supported, and monophyly of the 'Colotis group' and the genera Colotis and Eronia could not be established. To preserve the monophyly of Colotis, we revive the genus Teracolus for three outlying species previously in Colotis (i.e. Colotis eris, Colotis subfasciatus and Colotis agoye), as well as the genus Afrodryas for Eronia leda. The position of Calopieris is unresolved although it appears to be well outside the molecular variation in Colotis (s.l.). A dispersal/vicariance analysis suggested that major diversification in Colotis (s.str.) occurred in Africa with subsequent dispersal to India and Madagascar.
