N2 - Premise of the Study
The detection of environmental DNA (eDNA) using high‐throughput sequencing has rapidly emerged as a method to detect organisms from environmental samples. However, eDNA studies of aquatic biomes have focused on surveillance of animal species with less emphasis on plants. Pondweeds are important bioindicators of freshwater ecosystems, although their diversity is underestimated due to difficulties in morphological identification and monitoring.
Methods
A protocol was developed to detect pondweeds in water samples using atpB‐rbcL and ITS2 markers. The water samples were collected from the Grand River within the rare Charitable Research Reserve, Ontario (RARE). Short fragments were amplified using primers targeting pondweeds, sequenced on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, and assigned to the taxonomy using a local DNA reference library and GenBank.
Results
We detected two species earlier documented at the experimental site during ecological surveys (Potamogeton crispus and Stuckenia pectinata) and three species new to the RARE checklist (P. foliosus, S. filiformis, and Zannichellia palustris).
Discussion
Our targeted approach to track the species composition of pondweeds in freshwater ecosystems revealed underestimation of their diversity. This result suggests that eDNA is an effective tool for monitoring plant diversity in aquatic habitats.
