N2 - Lipolexis is a small genus in the subfamily Aphidiinae represented by one species in Europe
(Lipolexis gracilis Förster) and by four in Asia (Lipolexis wuyiensis Chen, L. oregmae Gahan, L. myzakkaiae
Pramanik and Raychaudhuri and L. pseudoscutellaris Pramanik and Raychaudhuri). Although
L. oregmae is employed in biological control programs against pest aphids, the last morphological
study on the genus was completed over 50 years ago. This study employs an integrative approach
(morphology and molecular analysis (COI barcode region)), to examine Lipolexis specimens that were
sampled worldwide, including specimens from BOLD database. These results establish that two
currently recognized species of Lipolexis (L. gracilis, L. oregmae) are actually a species complex and also
reveal phylogenetic relationships within the genus. Six new species are described and a global key
for the identification of Lipolexis species is provided.
