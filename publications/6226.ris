N2 - "The sex attractant for Phyllonorycter melanosparta (Meyrick, 1912) has been determined as (10E)-dodec-10-en-1-yl
acetate and (10E)-dodec-10-en-1-ol combined in a ratio 10:1. The distribution of this species in Eastern Africa is updated
and its presence in Kenya is recorded for the first time. We discuss the taxonomic status of P. melanosparta with
reference to three character sets: semiochemicals, morphological and molecular characters (DNA barcodes). This
combination of characters is also proposed as a new approach to study the diversity and phylogeny of Phyllonorycter in
the Afrotropical region."
