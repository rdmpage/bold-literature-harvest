N2 - An isolate of Trypanosoma cruzi obtained from P. megistus captured in the peridomicile area of a home in Santo Antonio do Jardim city in the State of Sao Paulo, denominated T. cruzi Mogi, was characterized biologically and molecularly. The RFLP analysis of the D7 divergent domain in the 24SÎ± rDNA and of the mini-exon positioned the T. cruzi isolate within the TcI group. Phylogenetic analysis performed with the trypanosomatid barcode confirmed that the isolate belongs to the TcI group, with high homology to the 3014 c1 T.cruzi strain. The biological characterization of the isolate in rats showed a prepatent period of about 8 days, low parasitemia and tropism for cardiac, skeletal and colonic muscles. In Swiss mice the T. cruzi Mogi isolate showed a prepatent period of about 22 days, intermittent parasitemia in some animals, and tropism for cardiac and colonic muscles. Despite the inherent difficulty of identifying correlations amongst the molecular and biological characteristics of different T. cruzi groups, the tropism for colonic muscle demonstrated by T. cruzi Mogi represented a peculiarity of this isolate within the TcI group.
