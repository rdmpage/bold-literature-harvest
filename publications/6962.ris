N2 - Ecological surveys of tropical tree communities have provided an important
source of data to study the forces that generate and maintain tropical diversity. Accurate
species identification is central to these studies. Incorrect lumping or splitting of species will
distort results, which may in turn affect conclusions. Although ecologists often work with
taxonomists, they likely make some identification errors. This is because most trees
encountered in the field are not reproductive and must be identified using vegetative
characters, while most species descriptions rely on fruit and flower characters. Because every
tree has DNA, ecological surveys can incorporate molecular approaches to enhance accuracy.
This study reports an extensive ecological and molecular survey of nearly 4000 trees belonging
to 55 species in the tree genus Inga (Fabaceae). These trees were sampled in 25 community
surveys in the southwestern Amazon. In a process of reciprocal illumination, trees were first
identified to species using vegetative characters, and these identifications were revised using
phylogenies derived from nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences.
We next evaluated the effects of these revised species counts upon analyses often used to
assess ecological neutral theory. The most common morphological identification errors
involved incorrectly splitting rare morphological variants of common species and incorrectly
lumping geographically segregated, morphologically similar species. Total error rates were
significant (6.8–7.6% of all individuals) and had a measurable impact on ecological analyses.
The revised identifications increased support for spatially autocorrelated, potentially neutral
factors in determining community composition. Nevertheless, the general conclusions of
community-level ecological analyses were robust to misidentifications. Ecological factors, such
as soil composition, and potentially neutral factors, such as dispersal limitation, both play
important roles in the assembly of Inga communities. In contrast, species-level analyses of
neutrality with respect to habitat were strongly impacted by identification errors. Although
this study found errors in morphological identifications, there was also strong evidence that a
purely molecular approach to species identification, such as DNA barcoding, would be prone
to substantial errors. The greatest accuracy in ecological surveys will be obtained through a
synthesis of traditional, morphological and modern, molecular approaches.
