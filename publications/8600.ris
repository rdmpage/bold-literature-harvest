N2 - The relationship between mating success and sequence divergence in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)/5.8S-D1/D2 rDNA region was examined in isolates tentatively assigned to Metschnikowia agaves and Starmerella bombicola. Both species are haplontic and heterothallic, such that the formation of mature asci can be used as a measure of genetic compatibility. Parsimony haplotype network analysis and mating success confirmed that all known isolates of M. agaves are conspecific. The previously reported D1/D2 polymorphism of five substitutions was not corroborated; the maximum divergence observed between any two strains was three substitutions, four with ITS. Of 39 putative S. bombicola strains, 36 formed an ITS-D1/D2 haplotype network using the 95% criterion. Thirty-five strains could mate with one or more compatible partner. The excluded strains did not mate. Mature asci arose from crosses between individuals differing by as many as five, but not six or seven substitutions in the D1/D2 domain. All strains capable of mating formed mature asci with at least one partner and all network members could be linked to another member by three or fewer substitutions. These results support the use of sequence divergence as a criterion for species delineation, but caution against describing poorly sampled species solely on the basis of that criterion.
