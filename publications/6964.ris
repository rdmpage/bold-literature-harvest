N2 - Boring sponges of the genus Pione (Hadromerida, Clionaidae) are easily recognizable due to their spiculation. However, species identification is challenging, as the potentially diagnostic morphological character states of different species often overlap. For this reason, this group of species is frequently referred to as the ‘Pione vastifica complex’, after the most well-studied species of the genus. Boring-sponge samples were collected in the Red Sea and identified as P. cf. lampa and P. cf. vastifica, respectively. So far, these two species names have usually been considered as valid, although some authors suggested them to be synonymous. Morphological analyses were performed on spicules and micro-erosion patterns by means of both light and scanning electron microscopy. Two apparent morphotypes can be distinguished, mainly by the growth form, but statistical analysis does not support a clear separation in two species. In addition, a DNA barcoding approach using sequences of CO1 has not identified any nucleotide sequence differences. These data support the hypothesis that P. cf. lampa and P. cf. vastifica from the Red Sea are conspecific.
