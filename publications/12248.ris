N2 - INTRODUCTION The large amount of DNA sequence data generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies often allows multiple samples to be sequenced in parallel on a single sequencing run. This is particularly true if subsets of the genome are studied rather than complete genomes. In recent years, target capture from sequencing libraries has largely replaced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the preferred method of target enrichment. Parallelizing target capture and sequencing for multiple samples requires the incorporation of sample-specific barcodes into sequencing libraries, which is necessary to trace back the sample source of each sequence. This protocol describes a fast and reliable method for the preparation of barcoded (“indexed”) sequencing libraries for Illumina’s Genome Analyzer platform. The protocol avoids expensive commercial library preparation kits and can be performed in a 96-well plate setup using multi-channel pipettes, requiring not more than two or three days of lab work. Libraries can be prepared from any type of double-stranded DNA, even if present in subnanogram quantity.
