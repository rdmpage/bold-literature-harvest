N2 - The complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of the gynogenetic triploid ginbuna (Carassius auratus langsdorfi, AZ3 line) has been cloned and sequenced. The genome consisted of 16,578 bp and encoded the same set of genes (13 proteins, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs) in addition to a D-loop region, as described for other vertebrate mtDNAs. Comparison with other teleost mtDNAs demonstrated that the protein/rRNA-coding regions of the ginbuna were highly homologous both in length and nucleotide composition to those of the carp, indicating fairly close relationship between the triploid ginbuna and the carp. Although the size of the ginbuna D-loop was almost the same as that of the carp, the nucleotide sequence showed a moderate variation. More comprehensive sequence data of the D-loop regions will lead to the elucidation of phylogenetic relationships among Carassius auratus subspecies.
