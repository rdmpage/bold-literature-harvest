N2 - A molecular phylogenetic hypothesis is presented for the anoplocephaline cestodes of placental mammals based on sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene, the nuclear-encoded 28S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer region I of rRNA (ITS1). The material consists of 35 species representing nine genera of cestodes, with emphasis on taxa parasitising rodents and lagomorphs in the Holarctic region. The resulting phylogenies show considerable disagreement with earlier systematic and phylogenetic hypotheses derived from morphology. Specifically, the results contradict the view of uterine morphology being the primary determinant of deeper phylogenetic splits within Anoplocephalinae. Also, the role of genital duplication as a means of generic divergence was not found to follow consistently the pattern suggested by earlier hypotheses. Colonisation of novel host lineages has evidently been the predominant mode of diversification in anoplocephaline cestodes of placental mammals; evidence for phyletic co-evolution was obscure. The phylogenies consistently distinguished a large monophyletic group including all species from arvicoline rodents (voles and lemmings), primarily representing the genera Anoplocephaloides Baer, 1923 and Paranoplocephala Lühe, 1910. Phylogenetic relationships within the "arvicoline clade" of cestodes were generally poorly resolved. Consistent support for nodes above and below the unresolved polytomy indicates a rapid radiation involving a nearly simultaneous diversification of many lineages, a scenario also proposed for the arvicoline hosts.
