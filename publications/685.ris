N2 - We analyzed a portion of mitochondrial COI gene sequences (658 bp) to investigate the genetic diversity and geographic variation of the swallowtail butterfly, Papilio xuthus L. (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), and the cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae). Papilio xuthus showed a moderate level of sequence divergence (0.91% at maximum) in 15 haplotypes, whereas Pi. rapae showed a moderate to high level of sequence divergence (1.67% at maximum) in 30 haplotypes, compared with other relevant studies. Analyses of population genetic structure showed that most populations are not genetically differentiated in both species. The distribution pattern of both species appears to be consistent with category IV of the phylogeographic pattern sensu Avise: a phylogenetic continuity, an absence of regional isolation of mtDNA clones, and extensive distribution of close clones. The observed pattern of genetic diversity and geographic variation of the two butterfly species seem to reflect the abundant habitats, abundant host plants, and flying abilities in connection with the lack of historical biogeographic barriers.
