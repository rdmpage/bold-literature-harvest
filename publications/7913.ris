N2 - Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess), Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard), and Liriomyza bryoniae (Kaltenbach), are three closely related and economically important leafminer pests in the world. This study examined the complete mitochondrial genomes of L. trifolii, L. huidobrensis and L. bryoniae, which were 16141 bp, 16236 bp and 16183 bp in length, respectively. All of them displayed 37 typical animal mitochondrial genes and an A + T-rich region. The genomes were highly compact with only 60â€“68 bp of non-coding intergenic spacer. However, considerable differences in the A + T-rich region were detected among the three species. Results of this study also showed the two ribosomal RNA genes of the three species had very limited variable sites and thus should not provide much information in the study of population genetics of these species. Data generated from three leafminers' complete mitochondrial genomes should provide valuable information in studying phylogeny of Diptera, and developing genetic markers for species identification in leafminers.
