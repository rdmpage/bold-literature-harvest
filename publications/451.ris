N2 - The presence of Pneumocystis organisms was detected by nested-PCR at mitochondrial large subunit (mtLSU) rRNA gene in 23 respiratory samples from Asian macaques representing two species: Macaca mulatta and M. fascicularis. A very high level of sequence heterogeneity was detected with 18 original sequence types. Two genetic groups of Pneumocystis could be distinguished from the samples. Within each group, the extent of genetic divergence was low (2.5+/-1.4% in group 1 and 2.3+/-1.7% in group 2). Genetic divergences were systematically higher when macaque-derived sequence types were compared with Pneumocystis mtLSU sequences from other primate species (from 5.3+/-2.7% to 19.3+/-3.0%). The two macaque-derived groups may be considered as distinct Pneumocystis species. Surprisingly, these Pneumocystis species were recovered from both M. mulatta and M. fascicularis suggesting that host-species restriction may not systematically occur in the genus Pneumocystis. Alternatively, these observations question about the species concept in macaques.
