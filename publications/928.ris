N2 - The Alcidae is a group of marine, wing-propelled diving birds known as auks that are distributed along the coasts of the northern oceans. It has been suggested that auks originated in the Pacific coastal shores as early as the Miocene, and dispersed to the Atlantic either through the Arctic coasts of Eurasia and North America (northern dispersal route), or through upwelling zones in the coastal areas of California to Florida (southern dispersal route), before the closure of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene. These hypotheses have not been tested formally because proposed phylogenies failed to recover fully bifurcating, well-supported phylogenetic relationships among and within genera. We therefore constructed a large data set of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences for 21 of the 23 species of extant auks. We also included sequences from two other extant and one extinct species retrieved from GenBank. Our analyses recovered a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis among and within genera. Aethia is the only genus for which we could not obtain strong support for species relationships, probably due to incomplete lineage sorting. By applying a Bayesian method of molecular dating that allows for rate variation across lineages and genes, we showed that auks became an independent lineage in the Early Paleocene and radiated gradually from the Early Eocene to the Quaternary. Reconstruction of ancestral areas strongly suggests that auks originated in the Pacific during the Paleocene. The southern dispersal route seems to have favored the subsequent colonization of the northern Atlantic Ocean during the Eocene and Oligocene. The northern route across the Arctic Ocean was probably only used more recently after the opening of the Norwegian Sea in the Middle Miocene and the opening of the Bering Strait in the Late Miocene. We postulate that the ancestors of auks lived in a warmer world than that currently occupied by auks, and became gradually adapted to feeding in cool marine currents with high biomass productivity. Hence, warmer tropical waters are now a barrier for the dispersal of auks into the Southern Hemisphere, as it is for penguins in the opposite direction.
