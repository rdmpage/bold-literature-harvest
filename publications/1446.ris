N2 - Nucleotide sequence data were generated from the gene regions COI, 16S, and arginine kinase to assess genetic variation within the Palearctic parasitoid, Microctonus aethiopoides, reared from Sitona discoideus, S. hispidulus, and Hypera postica collected from two proximate locations in Mediterranean France. Partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the molecular data provided strong support for the presence of at least two M. aethiopoides biotypes, one associated with Hypera species and the other with Sitona species. These new results combined with previously published data from 14 countries show that M. aethiopoides genetic variation is much more strongly correlated with host taxon than with sampling location. This contrasts with earlier perceptions that M. aethiopoides exhibits significant geographic variation, and helps to explain the widely varying biological control outcomes that have been obtained following the introductions of M. aethiopoides to Australia, New Zealand, and North America. The results strongly suggest that success rates and environmental safety in biological control would both be improved by ensuring that parasitoids collected in the native range are reared from the same host species as the one being targeted for control in the region of introduction. The results also provided insights both on the evolution of M. aethiopoides' host range, and on its evolutionary transition between solitary and gregarious larval development.
