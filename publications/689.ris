N2 - The complete mitochondrial genome 15,650 bp in size of the Deracantha onos has been determined. The gene content, base composition and codon usage of D. onos are coincident to typical hexapods mitochondrial genomes. Genes arrangement of D. onos is identical to Gryllotalpa orientalis, Ruspolia dubia and Anabrus simplex, in that the relative locations of tRNA(Lys) and tRNA(Asp) was different to that of Locusta migratoria. All tRNAs could be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure, excluding tRNA(Ser(AGN)) which forms another structure according to the Steinberg-Cedergren tertiary structure. Sequence analysis of the A + T-rich region with Dot-plot did not find any conspicuous repeat clusters. Two poly-thymine (poly-T) nucleotide stretches of 20 bp and 11 bp in size, which may involved in the recognition of replication origin, were found on the H-strand and L-strand in the A + T-rich region of the D. onos mitogenome, respectively. One open reading frame (ORF) 87 amino acids in size was found on the H-strand, but Protein Blast searches analysis indicated that it was a nonfunctional ORF.
