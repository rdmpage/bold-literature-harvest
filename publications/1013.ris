N2 - Inconsistencies between phylogenetic interpretations obtained from independent sources of molecular data occasionally hamper the recovery of the true evolutionary history of certain taxa. One prominent example concerns the primate infraordinal relationships. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear DNA sequences traditionally represent Tarsius as a sister group to anthropoids. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data only marginally support this affiliation or even exclude Tarsius from primates. Two possible scenarios might cause this conflict: a period of adaptive molecular evolution or a shift in the nucleotide composition of higher primate mtDNAs through directional mutation pressure. To test these options, the entire mt genome of Tarsius bancanus was sequenced and compared with mtDNA of representatives of all major primate groups and mammals. Phylogenetic reconstructions at both the amino acid (AA) and DNA level of the protein-coding genes led to faulty tree topologies depending on the algorithms used for reconstruction. We propose that these artifactual affiliations rather reflect the nucleotide compositional similarity than phylogenetic relatedness and favor the directional mutation pressure hypothesis because: (1) the overall nucleotide composition changes dramatically on the lineage leading to higher primates at both silent and nonsilent sites, and (2) a highly significant correlation exists between codon usage and the nucleotide composition at the third, silent codon position. Comparisons of mt genes with mt pseudogenes that presumably transferred to the nucleus before the directional mutation pressure took place indicate that the ancestral DNA composition is retained in the relatively fossilized mtDNA-like sequences, and that the directed acceleration of the substitution rate in higher primates is restricted to mtDNA.
