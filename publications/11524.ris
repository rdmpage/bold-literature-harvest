N2 - Clarkston B.E. and Saunders G.W. 2012. An examination of the red algal genus Pugetia (Kallymeniaceae, Gigartinales), with descriptions of Salishia firma gen. & comb. nov., Pugetia cryptica sp. nov. and Beringia wynnei sp. nov. Phycologia 51: 33–61. DOI: 10.2216/11-01.1 The red algal family Kallymeniaceae was surveyed along the west coast of Canada using the DNA barcode (COI-5P – 5′ region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene) as a species identification tool. A total of 253 specimens field identified as Pugetia spp. subsequently resolved as five genetic species groups, although only two are reported in the flora. Additionally, COI-5P data were available for the Chilean P. chilensis, which resolved as a distinct species. Subsequent analysis of the internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal cistron and the universal plastid amplicon (domain V of the 23S rRNA gene) resolved the same groups as COI-5P. Phylogenetic relationships of the Canadian groups were investigated using large-subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU) and a combined analysis of LSU and COI-5P data. One species was divergent from the Pugetia spp. in all analyses and grouped closely with the kallymeniacean genera Erythrophyllum (Kallymeniaceae, Gigartinales) and Kallymeniopsis (Kallymeniaceae, Gigartinales) − it is here described as Beringia wynnei sp. nov. The other ‘Pugetia’ species fell into two divergent clusters in phylogenetic analyses, differing also in blade thickness, carpogonial branch morphology and the association of the auxiliary cell relative to the carpogonium (procarpic vs nonprocarpic). We retain the genus Pugetia for the type species P. fragilissima and P. cryptica sp. nov. and describe the new genus Salishia for Salishia firma (Kylin) comb. nov., S. sanguinea (Montagne) comb. nov. and S. chilensis (J. Agardh) comb. nov. Finally, we completed morphological and anatomical examinations of other Pugetia species to provide a comprehensive review of the genus.
