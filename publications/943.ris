N2 - To construct the molecular systematics of the genus Megoura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), DNA based-identifi-cation was performed using four mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA regions: partial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), partial tRNA-leucine + cytochrome c oxidase II (tRNA/COII), cytochrome b (CytB), partial 12S rRNA + tRNA-valine + 16S rRNA (12S/16S), elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1 alpha), and the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1, ITS2). Pairwise sequence divergences between taxa were compared, and phylogenetic analyses were performed based on each DNA region separately, and the combined datasets. COI, CytB, EF1 alpha, ITS1, and ITS2 were relatively effective in determining species and resolving their relationships. By contrast, the sequences of tRNA/COII and 12S/16S were not able to separate the closely related species. CytB and EF1alpha gave better resolution with higher average sequence divergences (4.7% for CytB, 5.2% for EF1 alpha). The sequence divergence of COI (3.0%) was moderate, and those of the two ITS regions (1.8% for ITS1, 2.0% for ITS2) were very low. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by minimum evolution, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that the phylogenetic relationships between Megoura species were associated with their host preferences. Megoura brevipilosa and M. lespedezae living on Lespedeza were closely related, and M. nigra, monophagous on Vicia venosa, was rather different from M. crassicauda, M. litoralis, and M. viciae, which are oligophagous on Lathyrus and Vicia. The three populations of M. crassicauda formed a clade separated from M. litoralis and M. viciae. Nevertheless M. litoralis and M. viciae, which are morphologically similar, were not separated due to negligible sequence divergence. We discuss the phylogenetic relationships of the Megoura, and the usefulness of the seven DNA regions for determining the species level phylogeny of aphids.
