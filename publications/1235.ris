N2 - We isolated mitochondrial DNA from the rayfish Raja porosa by long-polymerase chain reaction (Long-PCR) with conserved primers, and sequenced it by primer walking method using flanking sequences as sequencing primers. R. porosa mitochondrial DNA consists of 16,972 bp and its structural organization is conserved in comparison with other fishes and mammals. Based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) sequence, the phylogenetic position of R. porosa among cartilaginous fishes was inferred using different phylogenetic methods (ML-based quartet puzzling, Neighbor-joining (NJ) and Bayesian approaches). In this paper, we report the characteristics of the R. porosa mitochondrial genome including structural organization, base composition of rRNAs, tRNAs and protein-encoding genes and characteristics of mitochondrial tRNAs. These findings are applicable to comparative mitogenomics of R. porosa with other related taxa.
