N2 - Background: Large natural history collections are a crucial resource of diverse and rare specimens, but their genetic reserves are underutilized. For the last decade, the Centre for Biodiversity Genomics (CBG) has worked to reverse this trend and has set the standard for DNA barcode-based museum processing pipelines. Past efforts were often limited by specimen age, preservation method, and ultimately DNA quality. However, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have made it possible to amplify and sequence DNA from old and rare specimens, even with very limited quantities of DNA. CBG's partnership with the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) in Washington DC is an exemplar of this system, which incorporates both Sanger- and HTS-based methods to maximize sequencing success rates based on predicted DNA quality. Results: To date, over 120 000 specimens from the NMNH have been DNA barcoded and deposited in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD). The current focus of this partnership remains on building the barcode reference library of North American Lepidoptera, which is nearing completion. However, efforts have recently expanded to include barcoding the world genera of Lepidoptera, where significant progress can be made at the NMNH due to its vast archives of authoritatively identified material from around the globe. In parallel, the CBG is also working towards completing barcode coverage for every insect family with the assistance of the NMNH. Significance: While contributing valuable digitization services to participating institutions, the CBG's museum harvesting pipeline is also producing an invaluable reference barcode library for BOLD, and for the communityasawhole. This resource is of critical importance for parameterizing the BOLD Identification Engine, and it will undoubtedly assist its users with the discovery of new, rare, and exciting taxa.
