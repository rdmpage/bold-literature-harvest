N2 - Systematics, or taxonomy, is the study of the diversity of life on Earth. Its goals are to discover
and describe new biological diversity and to understand its evolutionary and biogeographic origins and
relationships. Here we review the contributions to the field of systematics and taxonomy published over
the last 25 y in J-NABS and its predecessor Freshwater Invertebrate Biology (FIB). We examined a total of 64
studies that we considered to be largely taxonomic in nature. We classified these studies into 2 major
categories: morphological (e.g., descriptive taxonomy, taxonomic revisions) and molecular (e.g.,
deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] barcoding, population genetics). We examined studies in 5-y increments
for J-NABS. We also studied the period 1982 to 1985, during which FIB was published. On average, 12
taxonomic studies were published within each 5-y period. Molecular studies first appeared in 1986 and
have slowly increased, reaching their greatest number within the last 5 y. Studies also were classified by
their individual attributes. Morphological studies were, by far, the most common, but studies also included
molecular data, biological information, distributional data, keys, and biogeographical analyses. Most
studies included .1 of these attributes. Overall, the role of J-NABS in the development of benthic
taxonomy has been minimal in terms of number of publications, but as part of the nexus of taxomonic
literature, all contributions have been important to the discipline. We discuss these contributions and their
impact on the following subject areas: taxonomy and revisionary systematics, phylogenetic and molecular
systematics, taxonomic resources, taxonomic resolution, conservation and taxonomy, professional training,
taxonomic certification, and graduate education. We also give an overview of new developments in the
taxonomists’ toolbox. These developments include DNA barcoding, online taxonomic resources, digital
identification keys, cybertaxonomy, and modern museum collections and resources.
