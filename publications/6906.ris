N2 - A total of 75 single individuals of 30 species pertaining to 19 genera of Sciaenidae was barcoded by CO1 genes, sequenced and compared with that of other Sciaenidae species recorded in GenBank. Our results indicate that the averaged GC content accounting for 48.3%. The GC content of codon position 2 averaged 56.6% (51.0%—58.4%), that of position 1 for 44.9% (27.6%—54.1%), and that of position 3 ranged 41.6%—43.6% in average of 42.7%. The average Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) distances within-species and pairwise-species were 0.6% and 21%, respectively. The K2P distance pairwise-species was 35 times as much as that of within-species. According to the maximum parsimony and neighbour-joining trees for all 75 sequences, 28 species (93.3%) were of monophyly and 18 genera (94.7%) were in individual branch. The genetic distance between Collichthys niveatus and C. lucidus inferred that the genetic differentiation has not yet reached the level of species variation, which is different from the morphological conclusion. Both the similarity of morphological characters and the homology of barcoding sequence of Pennahia anea and Argyrosomus argentatus suggest that these two species should be a synonym of the same species. In addition, two geographical groups of Otolithes rubber might be of two different species. Consequently, the CO1 barcoding is one of the useful tools to both fish species classification and phylogeny of Family Sciaenidae.
