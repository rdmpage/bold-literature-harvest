N2 - Codium recurvatum is described from material collected on a Tanzanian reef slope. The diminutive species is easily recognized by its unusual morphology, as its thallus consists of several dorsiventrally flattened lobes originating from a central holdfast and curving back towards the substratum. DNA barcodes (rbcL exon 1 and tufA) confirm the distinctness of the species and the phylogenetic placement of the new species is inferred from a concatenated alignment of rbcL and rps3â€“rpl16 sequences.
