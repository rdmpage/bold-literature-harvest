N2 - This article offers comments about DNA barcoding in taxonomy. The author states that the pace of change is so fast in the molecular and phylogenetic communities that traditional taxonomic practice is struggling to keep up. The concept of DNA barcoding is described and why it has become a controversial subject. There is tension within the taxonomic community between those that stress taxonomy's value as a science and those that emphasize its value as a service. Key events at the Partnerships for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy (PEET) DNA barcoding symposium are included.
