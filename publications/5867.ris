N2 - Identification of fern gametophytes is generally hampered by low morphological complexity. Here we explore an alternative: DNA-based identification. We obtained a plastid rbcL sequence from a sterile gametophyte of unknown origin (cultivated for more than 30 years) and employed blast to determine its affinities. Using this approach, we identified the gametophyte as Osmunda regalis. To evaluate the robustness of this determination, and the usefulness of rbcL in differentiating among species, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of osmundaceous fern sequences. Based on our results, it is evident that DNA-based identification has considerable potential in exploring the ecology of fern gametophytes.
