N2 - Lepetodrilid limpets are common inhabitants of deep-sea hydrothermal vents worldwide, but the frequent
occurrence of morphologically cryptic species makes their identification very difficult. To facilitate these identifications, we
provide DNA barcodes based on ;1,000 bp of cytochrome-c-oxidase subunit I (COI), for 20 taxa within the genus Lepetodrilus.
The method was also used to identify lepetodrilids that were found living on vent decapods. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis
resolved relationships among members of several cryptic species complexes; however, COI sequences alone were unable to resolve
higher-level systematic relationships caused by saturation of synonymous nucleotide substitutions.
