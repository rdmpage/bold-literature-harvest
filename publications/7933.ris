N2 - The Baltic Sea is one of the worldâ€™s most intensive centres for maritime traffic. This
sea has become an important recipient of alien species transported with ballast
water from all over the world. Sibling species are a special group of invasive animals that are hardly distinguishable from relative but often ecologically different
local species. In this study, a molecular genetic diagnosis was performed, based
on the analysis of DNA nucleotide sequences (barcoding) in the populations of a
dominant circumpolar speciesEurytemora affinis(Poppe, 1880) from the Gulf of
Finland and the Atlantic coast of European estuaries and ofEurytemora carolleeae
Alekseev and Souissi, 2011, a new North American suspected invasive form. The
results of the diagnosis were completed by morphological analyses. Considering
the key role ofE. affinisin the Baltic Sea zooplankton community, the invasion of
E. carolleeaemight have consequences for biodiversity, biogeography, conservation
and ecosystem management in this area.
