N2 - Background: DNA barcoding uses a 650 bp segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene as the
basis for an identification system for members of the animal kingdom and some other groups of eukaryotes. PCR
amplification of the barcode region is a key step in the analytical chain, but it sometimes fails because of a lack of
homology between the standard primer sets and target DNA.
Results: Two forward PCR primers were developed following analysis of all known arthropod mitochondrial genome
arrangements and sequence alignment of the tRNA-W gene which was usually located within 200 bp upstream of the
COI gene. These two primers were combined with a standard reverse primer (LepR1) to produce a cocktail which
generated a barcode amplicon from 125 of 141 species that included representatives of 121 different families of
Hexapoda. High quality sequences were recovered from 79% of the species including groups, such as scale insects,
that invariably fail to amplify with standard primers.
Conclusions: A cocktail of two tRNA-W forward primers coupled with a standard reverse primer amplifies COI for most
hexapods, allowing characterization of the standard barcode primer binding region in COI 5' as well as the barcode
segment. The current results show that primers designed to bind to highly conserved gene regions upstream of COI
will aid the amplification of this gene region in species where standard primers fail and provide valuable information to
design a primer for problem groups.
